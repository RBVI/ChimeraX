These scripts provided by Tristan Croll to compile OpenMM using a CentOS 7 Docker Singularity image
using a C++ compiler compatible with the ChimeraX distribution compiler.  This allows ISOLDE
to link to both OpenMM and ChimeraX atomic_lib using the same C++ compiler.

These scripts were provided in ChimeraX ticket #3756 and the compiled build was provided
in ticket #4661.
