"""
This Qt shim module allows using PyQt5 or PySide2 Python bindings to the Qt C++ library.
It allows easily switching between these two almost equivalent bindings without changing
all the imports in application code.

In the future we will try to also allow using PyQt6 and PySide6 if Qt 6 is sufficiently
compatible with Qt 5.

PyQt5 is used if it can be imported, otherwise PySide2 is used.

Example use:

>>> from Qt.QtWidgets import QPushButton

This shim was derived from qtpy version 1.9.0.  For a variety reasons it seemed best not
to try to patch all the deficiencies in qtpy.  I also tried Qt.py 1.3.3 -- it did not have
support for QtWebEngine.

Problems with qtpy included: It did not have QWebEngineCore and QWebEngineProfile.
The missing classes were reported years ago and ignored by the developers suggesting a lack of
support.  Most of the code was to handle the ancient PyQt4 and PySide.  Also it tried to
handle Python 2 and 3.  We don't need support for those ancient versions.
It did not wrap a method to determine object deletion (sip.isdeleted(), shiboken2.isValid()).
It did not have PyQt6 or PySide6 support and a ticket asking about that got no response.
The wrapping is very simple, and especially for experimenting with Qt 6 support it seemed
more productive to use our own shim code.
