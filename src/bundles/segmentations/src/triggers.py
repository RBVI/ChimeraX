Segmentations triggers ======================

This module wraps chimerax.core.triggerset, and provides public signals all
other code may subscribe to. Module level functions are the same as TriggerSet
functions.

SEGMENTATION_ADDED: Activated when this bundle's segmentation tracker recognizes
                    a new segmentation has been opened. May be emitted at the
                    end of this bundle's ADD_MODEL trigger handler.

SEGMENTATION_REMOVED: Activated when this bundle's segmentation tracker
                      recognizes an open segmentation has been closed. May be
                      emitted at the end of this bundle's REMOVE_MODEL trigger
                      handler.

SEGMENTATION_MODIFIED: Should be activated any time a segmentation is modified,
                       i.e. regions are added to or subtracted from the
                       segmentation.

AXIAL_CURSOR_MOVED: Activated whenever the user moves their mouse over a
                    PlaneViewer displaying an axial slice.

CORONAL_CURSOR_MOVED: Activated whenever the user moves their mouse over a
                      PlaneViewer displaying a coronal slice.

SAGITTAL_CURSOR_MOVED: Activated whenever the user moves their mouse over a
                       PlaneViewer displaying a sagittal slice.

SPHERE_CURSOR_MOVED: Activated whenever the segmentation sphere is moved by the
                     corresponding mouse or hand mode.

AXIAL_CURSOR_RESIZED: Activated whenever the user resizes the segmentation
                      cursor in a PlaneViewer displaying an axial slice.

CORONAL_CURSOR_RESIZED: Activated whenever the user resizes the segmentation
                        cursor in a PlaneViewer displaying a coronal slice.

SAGITTAL_CURSOR_RESIZED: Activated whenever the user resizes the segmentation
                         cursor in a PlaneViewer displaying a sagittal slice.

SPHERE_CURSOR_RESIZED: Activated whenever the user resizes the spherical
                       segmentation cursor using the corresponding mouse or hand
                       mode.

AXIAL_PLANE_VIEWER_ENTER: Activated when the mouse enters a PlaneViewer
                          displaying an axial slice

CORONAL_PLANE_VIEWER_ENTER: Activated when the mouse enters a PlaneViewer
                            displaying a coronal slice

SAGITTAL_PLANE_VIEWER_ENTER: Activated when the mouse enters a PlaneViewer
                             displaying a sagittal slice

AXIAL_PLANE_VIEWER_LEAVE: Activated when the mouse leaves a PlaneViewer
                          displaying an axial slice

CORONAL_PLANE_VIEWER_LEAVE: Activated when the mouse leaves a PlaneViewer
                            displaying a coronal slice

SAGITTAL_PLANE_VIEWER_LEAVE: Activated when the mouse leaves a PlaneViewer
                             displaying a sagittal slice

VIEW_LAYOUT_CHANGED: (EXPERIMENTAL) Activated when the view layout changes. May
                     be moved to chimerax.ui

GUIDELINES_VISIBILITY_CHANGED: Activated when a UI or command changes the
                               visibility of the guidelines over PlaneViewers.
                               Callers will need to set the value of
                               the display_guidelines attribute of a Segmentations
                               bundle settings object before activating.
                               Listeners should re-read this bundle's settings
                               and react accordingly to the new value.
                               If you are both a caller and a listener, take care
                               to block your own handler when activating.
