Adapting the foldseek search and visualization code to handle mmseqs2 and blast searches requires
changes in many places.  The trouble is that foldseek uses indexing based on just the structure residues
that have coordinates.  The first structure residue with coordinates is index 1.  The mmseqs2 and blast
sequence searches use indexing based on the full residue sequence including many residues without
coordinates.  So the code needs to handle these two types of indexing differently when interpreting
alignments and finding corresponding structure residues, for instance, for showing backbone traces,
clustering structures based on C-alpha positions, computing LDDT score.  Maybe I should call the
two types of indices, coordinate indices and sequence indices.  With foldseek the alignment uses
coordinate indices while with mmseqs2/blast it uses sequence indices.  Routines that use the residue
indices need two versions to handle these two cases.

The sequence plot is currently using the alignment indexing so it includes residues without coordinates for mmseqs2.
But the code that sets query residue attributes coverage, conservation, entropy and lddt currently won't work
correctly since it assumes the columns of the alignment match the query residues with coordinates.
I could fix that by mapping the residue coordinate index to the alignment index.
