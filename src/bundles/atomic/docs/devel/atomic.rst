atomic: Atomic structures
=========================

Atomic data, such as molecules read from a Protein Databank file, is managed in C++ data structures
which are made available through the following equivalent Python classes:

 * :class:`.AtomicStructure`
 * :class:`.Atom`
 * :class:`.Bond`
 * :class:`.Residue`
 * :class:`.Chain`, which is based on :class:`.StructureSeq` which is in turn based on :class:`.Sequence`

Also lines between atoms depicting distances or missing segments of a protein backbone are
represented as pseudobonds:

 * :class:`.Pseudobond`
 * :class:`.PseudobondGroup`
 * :class:`.PseudobondManager`

Efficient collections of molecular objects and molecular surfaces are also available
