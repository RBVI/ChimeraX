segment: Segmentations of density maps
======================================

Routines for calculating properties of index map segmentations.

Index map segmentations are 3D numpy arrays of uint32 values where the value
indicates which region the grid point belongs to.  Region index values start at 1,
the value 0 indicates the grid point does not belong to any region.  Corresponding
image data 3d arrays can have any scalar type supported by numpy (int8, uint8, int16,
uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64, float32, float64).
