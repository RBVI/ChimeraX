        # the packaging metadata.
        # Each deliverable needs to classified into one or more toolshed
        # categories from chimerax.core.toolshed.
        #
        # Bundle Metadata:
        # ----------------
        #
        "ChimeraX-Bundle :: categories :: session_versions :: api_module_name :: aliases :: custom_session_init",
        #
        # 'categories' is a comma separated string.  The categories should
        # be a subset of the toolshed categories.
        # 'session_versions' is a comma-separated two-tuple of
        # integers, representing the minimum and maximum session
        # versions that this tool can read.
        # 'api_module_name' is a string with the name of the module that
        # has the bundle_api in it.
        # 'custom_session_init' is a string.  If not set to 'true', the
        # bundle is not imported until actually invoked.  If set to
        # 'aliases' is an optional comma separated list of previous bundle
        # names.
        # 'true', the 'initialize' method is called after the main
        # session has been created.
        #
        # For example:
        #
        #       ChimeraX-Bundle :: Volume data :: 1,1 ::
        #
        # Tool Metadata:
        # --------------
        #
        "ChimeraX-Tool :: tool_name :: categories :: synopsis",
        #
        # 'tool_name' is a string.
        # 'categories' should be a subset of the bundle's categories. 
        # 'synopsis' is a short description of the tool.  It is here for
        # uninstalled tools, so that users can get more than just a
        # name for deciding whether they want the tool or not.
        # Tools are created via the bundle's 'start_tool' function.
        # Bundles may provide more than one tool.
        #
        # For example:
        #
        #       ChimeraX-Tool :: Help Viewer :: General :: Show help
        #
        # Command Metadata:
        # -----------------
        #
        "ChimeraX-Command :: name :: categories :: synopsis",
        #
        # 'name' is a string and may have spaces in it.
        # 'categories' should be a subset of the bundle's categories. 
        # 'synopsis' is a short description of the command.  It is here for
        # uninstalled commands, so that users can get more than just a
        # name for deciding whether they want the command or not.
        # Bundles may provide more than one command.
        # Commands are lazily registered, so the argument specification
        # isn't needed until the command is first used.
        #
        # For example:
        #
        #       ChimeraX-Command :: exit :: General :: terminate ChimeraX
        #
        # Data Format Metadata:
        # ---------------------
        #
        "ChimeraX-DataFormat :: format_name :: alternate_names :: category :: suffixes :: mime_types :: url :: dangerous :: icon :: synopsis",
        #
        # 'data_name' is a string.
        # 'alternate_names' is an optional comma-separated list of strings.
        # 'category' is a toolshed category.
        # 'suffixes' is an optional comma-separated list of strings with
        # leading periods, i.e., '.pdb'.
        # 'mime_types' is an optinal comma-separated list of strings, e.g.,
        # chemical/x-pdb.
        # 'url' is a string that has a URL that points to the data format's docmentation.
        # 'dangerous' is an optional boolean and should be 'true' if the data
        # format is insecure -- defaults to true if a script.
        # 'icon' is an optional string containing the filename of the icon --
        # it defaults to the default icon for the category.
        # 'synopsis' is a short description of the data format.  It is here
        # because it needs to be part of the metadata available for
        # uninstalled data format, so that users can get more than just a
        # name for deciding whether they want the data format or not.
        # Bundles may provide more than one data format.
        # The data format metadata includes everything needed for the Mac OS X
        # application property list.
        #
        # For example:
        #
        #       ChimeraX-DataFormat :: PDB :: :: Molecular Structure :: .pdb, .ent :: chemical/x-pdb :: http://www.pdb.org/ :: :: :: Protein DataBank file
        #       ChimeraX-DataFormat :: mmCIF :: :: Molecular Structure :: .mmcif, .cif :: chemical/x-mmcif :: http://www.pdb.org/ :: :: :: MacroMolecular CIF
        #
        # In addition to describing the format, the bundle should say how if it
        # can fetch, open or save data in that format.
        #
        "ChimeraX-Open :: format_name :: tag :: is_default",
        "ChimeraX-Save :: format_name :: tag :: is_default",
        "ChimeraX-Fetch :: database_name :: format_name :: prefixes :: example_id :: is_default",
        #
        # 'format_name' is a format previously given in a ChimeraX-DataFormat
        # line.
        # 'database_name' is a string with the name of the databasea to fetch
        # the data from.
        # 'prefixes' is a comma-separated list of strings associated with the
        # (database_name, format_name).
        # 'example_id' is a string with an example identifier.
        # 'tag' is a string is disambiguate multiple readers or writers.
        # 'is_default' is a string.  If set to 'true', this format is
        # the default format for the database.
        #
        # For example:
        #
        #       ChimeraX-Open :: PDB :: PDB ::
        #       ChimeraX-Save :: PDB :: PDB ::
        #       ChimeraX-Fetch :: PDB :: mmcif :: pdb :: 1a0m ::
        #       ChimeraX-Fetch :: PDB :: PDB :: :: 1a0m ::
        #
        "ChimeraX-Selector :: name :: synopsis",
        #
        # 'name' is a string and may have spaces in it.
        # 'synopsis' is a short description of the selector.  It is here for
        # uninstalled selectors, so that users can get more than just a
        # name for deciding whether they want the selector or not.
        # Bundles may provide more than one selector.
