# TL;DR Do not modify monailabel.py to register this command
# ----
# This has to be here or else ChimeraX complains that the next three commands are
# 'incomplete', but it is not intended to be registered as the logic for that command
# would be very complex, with many arguments that would have to be listed but couldn't
# be concisely shown to be mutually exclusive (blame the CLI from the tool).
