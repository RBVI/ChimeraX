I'd like to look at how fentanyl interacts with the opioid receptor, PDB 8ef5
Could you hide the G proteins?  Also hide the antibody.
Show the receptor as ribbon
Show just one copy of the receptor
Can you show the protein residues near fentanyl in stick style
Can you show hydrogen bonds between fentanyl and the protein?  How many are there?
