<h1>IMOD Binary File Format. Version 1,  Revision 2</h1>

The IMOD binary file format is similar to the IFF format standard in
that it uses chunk id's for data headings. Each chunk id is 4 bytes
long and is defined as a string of 4 characters.
This is the format used by IMOD Version 2.0 available from the
Boulder Laboratory for Three-Dimensional Electron Microscopy of Cells.
The format is backwards compatible with IMOD 1.2.
All numbers are stored in big-endian format regardless of 
machine architecture.  In the descriptions of flags below, 
bits are numbered from 0.


<h3>The File Header</h3>

All binary model files begin with a 8 byte ID followed by a 184 byte header.
The ID format begins with the IMOD file id, (IMOD = 0x494d4f44)
followed by the 4 byte version id, (V1.2 =  0x56312e32).
The end of the file is marked by an end of data marker, (IEOF = 0x49454f46).

<h3>The Mesh Data Structure</h3>
The mesh ID is (MESH = 0x4d455348) and the basic structure is
20 bytes long.  Vertex data and index data follow the mesh header.

<pre>Length    Type         Name    Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4         int          vsize   Size of vertex array (# of triple floats).
4         int          lsize   Size of index array.
4         uint         flag    Bit 16 on  : normals have magnitudes.
                	       Bits 20-23 are resolution : 0 for high,

                                internal data structure but shorts in the file
12*vsize  float * 3    vert    Array of points.
4*lsize   int          index   Array of ints.
</pre>
<p>
A point can be either a vertex position or a normal vector at a vertex.
In current model files, <code>vert</code> consists of a sequence of 
vertex/normal pairs; i.e. vertex, normal, vertex, normal...  The 
<code>index</code> array has a list of indices into the <code>vert</code>
array plus negative index values with following meanings:
</p><pre>	-1   end of list array                
	-20  next item on list is normal vector.
	-21  begin concave polygon
        -22  end polygon
	-23  begin vertex,normal polygon pairs with normal,vertex indices
	-24  begin large convex polygon with normals.
	-25  begin vertex,normal polygon pairs with vertex indices

</pre>
Currently, meshes in model files consist only of polygons with vertex, normal
pairs, starting with -23 or -25 and ending with -22.  In polygons starting
with -23, each set
of 6 indices describes a triangle as follows:
<pre><i>index to normal 1</i>
<i>index to vertex 1</i>
<i>index to normal 2</i>
<i>index to vertex 2</i>
<i>index to normal 3</i>
<i>index to vertex 3</i>
</pre>
In polygons starting with -25, each normal is assumed to follow its
corresponding vertex, and each triangle is described by only 3 indices:
<pre><i>index to vertex 1</i>
<i>index to vertex 2</i>
<i>index to vertex 3</i>
</pre>

<h3>

Optional chunks can be put at the end of any data structure that the
information is intended for, or at the end of the file.

the ID.

MINX  Model to image transformation information.  (72 bytes data)
<p>
Coordinates are stored in an IMOD model file as image index coordinates 
relative to the last subset of image file that the model was displayed on.
The information here has two main uses.  1) It is used by 3dmod to display
the model
correctly when going between having a subset or the full image file loaded,
or when displaying on an image file with different origin, scaling, or rotation
angles in its header.  2) It is used by other programs to get back to the
index coordinates of the full image file.  These data consist
9 floats for old transformation values
followed by 9 floats for current transformation values.

</p><pre>Length Type         Name     Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12     float * 3    oscale   Old scale values (unused in file) 
12     float * 3    otrans   Old translations (file stores image origin values)
12     float * 3    orot     Old rotations around X, Y, Z axes (unused in file)
12     float * 3    cscale   New scale values in X, Y, Z
12     float * 3    ctrans   New translations in X, Y, Z
12     float * 3    crot     New rotations around X, Y, Z axes
</pre>

These values are based on the header information in the last image that
the model was displayed on: <code>cscale</code> is pixel spacing 
(cell size over grid size, <code>xlen/mx</code>); 
<code>crot</code> is taken from the current tilt angles; 
<code>ctrans</code> is based on
the origin minus the scale times the starting index coordinate of the image
loaded into 3dmod; <code>otrans</code> has the origin values.
<p>
To get from coordinates in a model file to an image file coordinate system,
first Y and Z are exchanged if the FLIPYZ flag is set, then coordinates
are multiplied by the scale values, translation values are subtracted, then
points are rotated by the negative of the rotation angles around X, 
then Y then Z.

<br>CLIP  Clipping planes for object. (Variable data size)
<br>MCLP  Global clipping planes for model. (Variable data size)
<br>As of IMOD 2.4.9, the object structure, model view structure, and object
view structure each has a clipping planes structure as a member, named
clips.  The latter structures are currently defined to hold 6 clipping
planes, but these chunks are written with only the number of planes
that exist, so their size is 4 + 24 * count.

Prior to IMOD 2.7.1, the 4 bytes of mat1 and the 4 bytes of mat3 were stored
as a UINT (big-endian, thus reversed from the current definition).  If bit 13

Prior to IMOD 2.7.1, the 4 bytes of mat1 and the 4 bytes of mat3 were stored
as a UINT.  If bit 13 of model flags is off, mat1 and mat3 are assumed to be
UINTs.

MOST  General storage information for model.   (Variable size)
<br>OBST  General storage information for object.   (Variable size)
<br>COST  General storage information for contour.   (Variable size)
<br>MEST  General storage information for mesh.   (Variable size)

These chunks contain extra information for their respective entities.  They
were designed to hold fine-grained display properties for objects, contours,
and meshes, but could be used for any kind of additional information that
will fit in the Store data structure.  The chunk consists of a series of 
Store entries, each 12 bytes long:
<pre>Length Type     Name    Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2      short    type    Type of information.  Currently defined types are:
                          1  Color change
                          2  Fill color change
                          3  Transparency change
                          4  Do not connect to next point or do not display
                          5  A connection number for meshing
                          6  3D line width change
                          7  2D line width change
                          8  Symbol type
                          9  Symbol size
2      short    flags   16 bits of flags.  Currently defined flags are:
                          Bits 0 and 1 indicate type of "index" and 2 and 3
                            indicate type of "value", with 0 for int, 1 for
                            float, 2 for short and 3 for byte
                          Bit 4 on : "index" is not really an index
                          Bit 5 on : Revert to default value
                          Bit 6 on : Index is surface number, not contour
                          Bit 7 on : The change applies to only one point
4      union    index   Can contain one int or float, 2 shorts, or 4 bytes,
                          generally has index of point or contour, or surface #
4      union    value   Can contain one int or float, 2 shorts, or 4 bytes
                          For colors, 3 bytes hold red, green, and blue
                          Transparency is stored as an int from 0 to 255
                          Symbol type is 0, 2, 3 for open circles, squares, or
                            triangles, -1, -3, -4 for closed circles, squares,
                            or triangles
