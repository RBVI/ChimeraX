<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Local EM Fitting</h3>
<p>
The <b>Local EM Fitting</b> tool in ChimeraX runs
<a href="https://phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/emplace_local.html"
target="_blank"><i>voyager.emplace_local</i></a> (included in the 
<a href="https://phenix-online.org" target="_blank">Phenix</a> nightly build)
to fit an atomic structure within a local region of cryo-EM density.
The command implementation is 
<a href="../commands/phenix.html#emplaceLocal"><b>phenix emplaceLocal</b></a>.

Limiting the search space to a local region of the map (subvolume)
can improve the signal-to-noise ratio and lead to success in cases 
where global search fails, in addition to being much faster.
The method is described in:

<p>
<a href="https://phenix-online.org" target="_blank">Phenix</a>
must be installed locally and the <b>PhenixUI</b> bundle installed in ChimeraX.
The program location can be specified (saved in
<a href="../preferences.html#other">preferences</a>) beforehand with the
<a href="../commands/phenix.html#location"><b>phenix location</b></a> command.
If no location has been specified, however, ChimeraX will look for a folder
name that starts with <b>phenix</b> in the user's home directory,
and on Mac only, if none is found there, then in the system
<b>/Applications</b> folder.
</p>
<a name="initial"></a>
<p>
<b>Local EM Fitting</b> 
can be started from the <b>Phenix</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu.
</p><p>
The atomic structure to <b>Fit</b> and the map(s) to use should already be
open in ChimeraX and chosen from the menus of available models; 
other maps and atomic structures may also be present.
The method evaluates signal and noise using two &ldquo;<b>half maps</b>&rdquo;
that cover the same spatial region but are each generated from half of the
experimental data. Alternatively, a single <b>full map</b> can be specified,
although results will not be as reliable as when half maps are used.
Additional settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Local map resolution</b> 
&ndash; approximate resolution of the map within the search space.
Although the local resolution is initially set to <b>0.0</b> &Aring;,
a positive value is required and must be supplied if a full map is used.
If half maps are used but no positive value is supplied,
the local resolution will be estimated from the half maps.
<li><b>Center search at</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>center of model...</b> center of the bounding box of the chosen model
  <li><b>center of selection</b> &ndash; center of the current 
<a href="../selection.html">selection</a>, <i>e.g.</i>,
one or more previously created <a href="../markers.html">markers</a>
  <li><b>center of view</b> &ndash; determined as follows:
    <ol>
    <li>if center-of-rotation crosshairs are displayed
(<b><a href="../commands/cofr.html">cofr</a> showPivot true</b>),
at the center of the crosshairs;
   <li>otherwise, if the <a href="../commands/cofr.html">center-of-rotation 
method</a> is <b>fixed</b>, at that center of rotation;
   <li>otherwise, if a single map is displayed, in the center of the graphics
window in the plane of the window (screen XY coordinates), and at the middle 
of the map's bounding box in depth (screen Z-coordinate)
   <li>otherwise, if more than one map is displayed, as immediately above except
using the bounding box of one of the half maps used in the fitting calculation
   </ol>
  <li><b>specified xyz position...</b> X, Y, and Z coordinates (&Aring;)
relative to the origin of the map and in the coordinate system of the map
  </ul>
<a name="adjust"></a>
<li><b>Interactively verify/adjust center before searching</b>
(initial default <b>on</b>)
&ndash; whether to generate a transparent orange
<a href="../markers.html">marker</a> to show the search space size and location.
Positions with any part of the atomic structure inside the marker sphere 
will be searched. The size of the search volume is based on the size of the 
structure and cannot be adjusted, but the search center can be moved by 
moving the marker, using any ChimeraX method for moving markers or models
(<i>e.g.</i>, clicking the <b>move markers</b>
<a href="markers.html" title="Markers...">
<img class="icon" border=1 src="mouse-icons/move.png"></a> icon
in the <a href="markers.html"><b>Markers</b></a> toolbar to assign the mode to 
the right mouse button, then using right-mouse click-drag to move the marker).
Clicking <b>Start search</b> starts the local fitting calculation.
<li><b>Make maps opaque while verifying center</b>
(only available when <a href="#adjust">interactive verification</a> is turned on;
initial default <b>on</b>)
&ndash; since ChimeraX only shows a single layer of transparency, 
the transparent orange sphere used to verify/adjust the search center 
will obscure any map surfaces or meshes that are also transparent.
This option temporarily makes map surfaces and meshes opaque
to prevent them from &ldquo;disappearing&rdquo; inside the orange sphere.
When the search is initiated and the sphere is removed, map surfaces 
are automatically reset to their previous transparency levels, if any.
<li><b>Show locally sharpened map computed by Phenix</b>
(initial default <b>off</b>)
&ndash; whether the sharpened map model generated by Phenix as part of
the calculation should be shown or hidden; either way, it can be shown/hidden
later using any of the usual methods 
(<a href="../commands/show.html"><b>show/hide</b></a> commands,
<a href="modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a> checkbox, <i>etc.</i>)
</ul>
<p>
If the <b>Interactively verify...</b> option mentioned above is not used,
clicking <b>Apply</b> on the main dialog (or <b>OK</b>, which also dismisses
the dialog) starts the local fitting calculation.
This calculation generally takes on the order of a minute;
after it completes, the atomic structure will be moved to the position of the
top fitting solution, and the sharpened map generated by Phenix as part of
the calculation will be opened as a new model.
</p><p>
<b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog without starting the calculation,
whereas <b>Help</b> shows this page
in the <a href="helpviewer.html"><b>Help Viewer</b></a>.
