<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Local EM Fitting</h3>
<p>
The <b>Local EM Fitting</b> tool in ChimeraX runs
<i>voyager.emplace_local</i> (included in the development version of the
<a href="https://phenix-online.org" target="_blank">Phenix</a> program)
<!--

to fit an atomic structure within a local region of cryo-EM density;
the command implementation is 
<a href="../commands/phenix.html#emplaceLocal"><b>phenix emplaceLocal</b></a>.

<a href="fitmap.html"><b>Fit in Map</b></a>,
<a href="waterplacement.html"><b>Water Placement</b></a>
</p><p>
Limiting the search space to a local region of the map can improve the
signal-to-noise ratio and lead to success in cases where global search fails,
in addition to being much faster. The method uses two &ldquo;half maps&rdquo;
that cover the same spatial region but are each generated from half of the
experimental data.
</p><p>
<a href="https://phenix-online.org" target="_blank">Phenix</a>
must be installed locally and the <b>PhenixUI</b> bundle installed in ChimeraX.
The program location can be specified (saved in
<a href="../preferences.html#other">preferences</a>) beforehand with the
<a href="../commands/phenix.html#location"><b>phenix location</b></a> command.
If no location has been specified, however, ChimeraX will look for a folder
name that starts with <b>phenix</b> in the user's home directory,
and on Mac only, if none is found there, then in the system
<b>/Applications</b> folder.

<b>Local EM Fitting</b> 
can be started from the <b>Phenix</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu.
The atomic structure to be fitted and both half maps should already be open
in ChimeraX; other maps (often the full map) and atomic structures may also 
be present. The structure to fit and the half maps should be chosen from
the menus of the available models. Other settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Map resolution</b> 
&ndash; initially <b>0.0</b>, but a suitable nonzero value should be 
specified by the user 
<li><b>Center search at</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>center of model...</b> center of the bounding box of the chosen model
  <li><b>center of view</b> &ndash; determined as follows:
    <ol>
    <li>if center-of-rotation crosshairs are displayed
(<b><a href="../commands/cofr.html">cofr</a> showPivot true</b>),
at the center of the crosshairs;
   <li>otherwise, if the <a href="../commands/cofr.html">center-of-rotation 
method</a> is <b>fixed</b>, at that center of rotation;
   <li>otherwise, if a single map is displayed, in the center of the graphics
window in the plane of the window (screen XY coordinates), and at the middle 
of the map's bounding box in depth (screen Z-coordinate)
   <li>otherwise, if more than one map is displayed, as immediately above except
using the bounding box of one of the half maps used in the fitting calculation
   </ol>
  <li><b>specified xyz position...</b> X, Y, and Z coordinates (&Aring;)
relative to the origin of the map and in the coordinate system of the map
  </ul>
<li><b>Interactively verify/adjust center before searching</b>
(initial default <b>on</b>)
&ndash; whether to generate a transparent orange
<a href="../markers.html">marker</a> to show the search space size and location.
Positions with any part of the atomic structure inside the marker sphere 
will be searched. The size of the search volume is based on the size of the 
structure and cannot be adjusted, but the search center can be moved by 
moving the marker, using any ChimeraX method for moving markers or models
(<i>e.g.</i>, clicking the <b>move markers</b>
<a href="markers.html" title="Markers...">
<img class="icon" border=1 src="mouse-icons/move.png"></a> icon
in the <a href="markers.html"><b>Markers</b></a> toolbar to assign the mode to 
the right mouse button, then using right-mouse click-drag to move the marker).
Clicking <b>Start search</b> starts the local fitting calculation.
</ul>
<p>
If the above option to interactively adjust the center was not used,
clicking <b>OK</b> on the main dialog starts the local fitting calculation.
This calculation generally takes on the order of a minute;
after it completes, the atomic structure will be moved to the position of the
top fitting solution, and the sharpened map generated by Phenix as part of
the calculation will be opened as a new model.
