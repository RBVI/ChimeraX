<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Fit Loops</h3>
<p>
The <b>Fit Loops</b> tool in ChimeraX runs
<a href="https://phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/fit_loops.html"
target="_blank"><i>fit_loops</i></a> (included in the 
<a href="https://phenix-online.org" target="_blank">Phenix</a> nightly build)
to build short peptides such as missing loops into density.
The command implementation is 
<a href="../commands/phenix.html#fitLoops"><b>phenix fitLoops</b></a>.

<a href="https://phenix-online.org" target="_blank">Phenix</a>
must be installed locally and the <b>PhenixUI</b> bundle installed in ChimeraX.
The program location can be specified (saved in
<a href="../preferences.html#other">preferences</a>) beforehand with the
<a href="../commands/phenix.html#location"><b>phenix location</b></a> command.
If no location has been specified, however, ChimeraX will look for a folder
name that starts with <b>phenix</b> in the user's home directory,
and on Mac only, if none is found there, then in the system
<b>/Applications</b> folder.
</p><p>
<b>Fit Loops</b> 
can be started from the <b>Phenix</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu.
The existing atomic <b>Structure</b> and the <b>Map</b> to use should
already be open in ChimeraX and chosen from the menus of available models; 
other maps and atomic structures may also be present.
</p><p>
The peptide segments to build or rebuild are specified by
<a href="../selection.html">selection</a>. 
The residues of interest can be <a href="../selection.html">selected</a>
using any method (menu, command, mouseclick
in the graphics window, the <b>Gaps</b> table mentioned below, <i>etc.</i>).
The residues in a missing segment or gap can be specified by selecting the 
corresponding missing-structure <a href="../pseudobonds.html">pseudobond</a>.
</p><p>
Although there is no limit on the total number of residues to model
in multiple segments, within an individual segment,
<font color="#DB7600">modeling &ge;15 consecutive residues is not
recommended</font> (is more likely to give poor results)
and <font color="red">modeling &ge;20 is disallowed</font>.
</p><p>
A table of the <b>Gaps</b> in the chosen structure is provided for convenience
if the goal is to fill in a missing segment, but it need not be used if
some other <a href="../selection.html">selection</a> method is preferred.
Clicking an entry in the table zooms in on the corresponding region 
and selects the missing-structure <a href="../pseudobonds.html">pseudobond</a>.
Only one entry can be chosen at a time. <b>Also select <i>N</i> residues
on each side of gap</b> allows specifying how many residues on either side of
the gap to include in the newly built portion. These end residues are also
<a href="../selection.html">selected</a> when an entry in the table is chosen,
and they are included in the count of consecutive residues to be modeled. 
Accordingly, the <b>Gap length</b> values in the table will be shown in 
<font color="red">red</font> when the total length (including the end residues)
is too great to model (disallowed), or in 
<font color="#DB7600">orange</font> if allowed but greater than recommended.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Apply</b> (or <b>OK</b>, which also dismisses the dialog)
starts the calculation.
<b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog without starting the calculation,
whereas <b>Help</b> shows this page
in the <a href="helpviewer.html"><b>Help Viewer</b></a>.
</p><p>
If the <b>Fit Loops</b> calculation gives an unsatisfactory result,
the structure can be reverted to its previous state with the
<a href="../commands/undo.html"><b>undo</b></a> command or by choosing
<a href="../menu.html#edit"><b>Edit... Undo</b></a> from the ChimeraX menu.
