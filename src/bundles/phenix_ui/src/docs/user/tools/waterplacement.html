<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Water Placement</h3>
<p>
The <b>Water Placement</b> tool in ChimeraX:
</p>
<ul>
<li>runs the <a href="https://phenix-online.org"
target="_blank">Phenix</a> program
<a href="https://phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/douse.html"
target="_blank"><i>douse</i></a> to place water molecules in cryo-EM density;
the command implementation is 
<a href="../commands/phenix.html#douse"><b>phenix douse</b></a>
<li>provides a graphical interface for inspecting and editing the results
</ul>
<p>
<a href="https://phenix-online.org" target="_blank">Phenix</a>
must be installed locally and the <b>PhenixUI</b> bundle installed in ChimeraX.
The program location can be specified (saved in
<a href="../preferences.html#other">preferences</a>) beforehand with the
<a href="../commands/phenix.html"><b>phenix</b></a> command.
If no location has been specified, however, ChimeraX will look for a folder
name that starts with <b>phenix</b> in the user's home directory,
and on Mac only, if none is found there, then in the system
<b>/Applications</b> folder.
</p><p>
After the <i>douse</i> calculation completes, the resulting waters,
as well as any that were already present in the atomic structure beforehand, 
can be inspected individually for H-bonds and agreement with the density, 
and optionally deleted.
</p><p>
The <a href="checkwaters.html"><b>Check Waters</b></a> tool is a 
similar interface for inspecting the waters already present in a structure.

<p>
The atomic structure and corresponding density map should be open
in ChimeraX before the tool is started. <b>Water Placement</b> 
can then be started from the <b>Phenix</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu.
An initial dialog will appear for choosing the atomic structure and map from 
menus of the available models, as well as other settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep waters from input structure</b> 
(initial default <b>on</b>) 
&ndash; whether to keep pre-existing waters instead of deleting them
<li><b>First shell only</b> (initial default <b>on</b>) 
&ndash; if keeping waters from the input structure, whether <i>douse</i>
should ignore them; since <i>douse</i> only places waters near existing atoms, 
ignoring pre-existing waters means that only waters that interact directly 
with the rest of the structure (&ldquo;first shell&rdquo;) will be added.
If this option is <b>off</b>, <i>douse</i> may place waters that interact 
directly with pre-existing waters but not the rest of the structure.
<li><b>Map resolution</b> (initial default <b>3.0</b> &Aring;)
(this option may not appear, depending on what version of Phenix is installed)
<li><b>Hide map far from waters</b> (initial default <b>on</b>) 
<li><b>Map-hiding distance</b> (initial default <b>8.0</b> &Aring;)
&ndash; what distance is considered far for map-hiding purposes
<li><b>Show residues with atoms within this distance of waters</b> 
(initial default <b>5.0</b> &Aring;)
<li><b>Show full douse output in log</b> (initial default <b>off</b>)
&ndash; whether to echo all <i>douse</i> messages to the 
<a href="log.html"><b>Log</b></a>
</ul>
<p>
Clicking <b>OK</b> initiates the <i>douse</i> calculation.
After the calculation completes, another panel will appear with a 
<a href="#waterlist">list of the waters</a> in the structure.
</p>

<a name="waterlist"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: Water Placement</a>]
</p>
<h3>List of Waters</h3>
<table class="clRight">
<tr><td>
<img class="outline" src="waterplacement.png"
alt="Water Placement dialog" width="340px">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
There are three options for which set of waters to list,
with their respective numbers of waters in parentheses:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Douse only</b> (initial default)
<li><b>In common</b>
<li><b>Input only</b>
</ul>
<p>
For each water, the list gives the number of <b>H-bonds</b>,
and if a corresponding density map was open before <b>Check Waters</b>
was started, the <b>Density</b> at atom positions summed over the atoms
in the residue: usually just one oxygen, but including hydrogens if present.
The list can be sorted on any column by clicking the column heading.
</p><p>
<a name="chosen"></a>
One or more waters can be <b><i>chosen</i></b> from the list
by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button;
<b>Ctrl</b>-click (or <b>command</b>-click if using a Mac)
toggles whether a water is chosen.  
Choosing waters in the list automatically
<a href="../selection.html">selects</a> them and focuses the view
on their near vicinities (atoms within 4&Aring;), slicing the structure
by placing near/far <a href="../commands/clip.html">clipping</a> planes.
</p><p>
<a name="hbonds"></a>
H-bonds are displayed as
<a href="../pseudobonds.html">pseudobonds</a> unless
<b>Show H-bonds</b> is turned off (initial default <b>on</b>).
Clicking <b>H-bond parameters</b> opens a separate dialog with
several of the calculation options that also appear in the
<a href="hbonds.html"><b>H-Bonds</b></a> tool;
clicking <b>Apply</b> recalculates the H-bonds accordingly.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking <b>Delete</b> deletes the chosen waters. 
Caution: deletion cannot be undone except by reopening the original structure.
<li><b>Go to next water in list after Delete</b>
&ndash; whether deleting a single water should automatically choose 
the next one in the list; either way, deleting multiple waters 
at the same time will not choose anything automatically.
<li>Clicking <b>Unclip</b> turns off 
<a href="../commands/clip.html">clipping</a>
to allow viewing the entire depth of the structure.
</ul>
