To test cgi script on macOS 10.15 I enabled the apache server by editing

   /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
   
to enable cgi scripts by uncommenting line

   LoadModule cgi_module libexec/apache2/mod_cgi.so

verifying the syntax with

   apachectl configtest
   
and starting the server with

   sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist

I put alphafold_search_cgi.py in the macOS cgi-bin directory

   sudo cp -p src/alphafold_search_cgi.py /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/

Then ChimeraX successfully used this blat sequence search using the Python requests
module.

To build a blast database from a fasta file for testing blastp I used

~/ucsf/ncbi-blast-2.12.0+/bin/makeblastdb -in alphafold.fasta -dbtype prot

which produces several files

alphafold.fasta.pdb
alphafold.fasta.phr
alphafold.fasta.pin
alphafold.fasta.pot
alphafold.fasta.psq
alphafold.fasta.ptf
alphafold.fasta.pto

Timing showed fasta and blastp were slower than blat searching for 7 sequences of PDB 3o81.
The blat time was only slightly different for 1 sequence, suggesting almost all time was loading
database and then .1 second per sequence to search.  While fasta and blastp time seemed to scale
linearly with time taking ~5 seconds per sequence.

Note fasta appears to be using 8 threads since user time is 8x real time.

To test the CGI script without a server I run it passing in some json test sequences.
Need to set CONTENT_LENGTH environment variable used by cgi script
