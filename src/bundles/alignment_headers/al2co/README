* Introduction
  This directory contains the conservation index calculation program: al2co.c.
The user provides a multiple sequence alignment (in ClustalW format) and 
specifies the calculation method; and the program will give the conservation  
index for each position in the alignment. Please refer to Pei & Grishin for  
the detail of the algorithm (1).

* Compilation
  cc al2co.c -o al2co -lm
  or
  gcc al2co.c -o al2co -lm

* Conservation calculation methods:
  Two steps are performed to estimate conservation of a position in a 
multiple sequence alignment. On the first step, amino acid frequencies
at the position are estimated. On the second step, conservation index is
calculated using the frequencies. An optional third step allows the user
to average the conservation indices over a window.

  The following Frequency estimation strategies are used.
1.1. Unweighted amino acid frequencies.

1.2. Weighted amino acid frequencies.
     We use modified Henikoff-Henikoff weighting scheme (2) that is  
applied in PSI-BLAST (3). The position is not used for weighting if it is 
invariant or contains gaps in no less than 50% of sequences.

1.3. Estimated independent counts.
     We use modified strategy of Sunyeav (4) to estimate independent 
counts of amino acids at a position (1).  

  Conservation index is then calculated using the frequencies by one of 
the following strategies:
2.1.Entropy-based measure.
  	C(i)=sum_{a=1}^{20}f_a(i)*ln[f_a(i)], where f_a(i) is the frequency
of amino acid a at position i.

2.2.Variance-based measure.
	C(i)=sqrt[sum_{a=1}^{20}(f_a(i)-f_a)^2], where f_a is the overall
frequency of amino acid a.

2.3.Sum-of-pairs measure.
	C(i)=sum_{a=1}^{20}sum_{b=1}^{20}f_a(i)*f_b(i)*S_{ab}, where
S_{ab} is the element of a scoring matrix for amino acids a and b.
If a reasonable amino acid substitution matrix S is applied,
this method takes into account the similarities between different 
amino acids. If the user want to make conservation indices the same for 
all invariant positions, the scoring matrix can be normalized (see 
-m option below). 

* The effect of gaps
  The presence of gaps at a position means that position is not necessary
in some proteins in correct alignment. So positions with gaps tend to
be less conserved (1). Gaps are not be treated the same way as amino acids  
in conservation calculation. 
  A gap fraction threshold is specified by the user (default value 0.5).
Conservation indices are calculated only for positions with gap fraction
less than that value. Then the mean value (mean) and standard deviation (sigma)
is calculated for these indices. For all positions with gap fraction no less
than the threshold, we set their conservation indices to be: mean-1.0*sigma.

	respectively. The integer part of each rescaled index is 
	written out along with the sequence alignment.
