A residue template file should be named with the residue's name followed by
the extension ".idatmres".  The file should contain one line for each atom
in the residue.  The line should start with that atom's name, followed by
whitespace, followed by that atom's IDATM type.

If the atom type for that atom differs under some conditions (usually if the
residue is terminal) then add whitespace followed by the condition when the
type differs, followed by whitespace, followed by the differing type.  The
conditions currently supported are:
	syntax				meaning
	atom name followed by "?"	If an atom by that name exists in
					the residue, then use the conditional
					type.  For example, for peptides the
					existence of atom OXT in the residue
					may influence the atom types of other
					atoms.

	atom name followed by "."	If the named atom is terminal (doesn't
					connect to another residue) then use
					the conditional type.  For instance, in
					peptides whether atom N is terminal
					determines its type.

If the IDATM type is given as "-" (without quotes), then that atom's type
will be computed despite the presence of the template.  Comments can be
inserted in a template file as lines that start with '#'.
