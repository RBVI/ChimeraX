// DON'T FORGET TO UPDATE Structure::copy() AS WELL!!
// ALSO: bump maxSessionVersion in atomic's bundle_info.xml and STRUCTURE_STATE_VERSION in structure.py
//
// Each class's SESSION_NUM... methods yield the number of those types that don't vary on
// a per-instance basis and are directly saved/restored by that class and not by a contained
// class such as Rgba.
