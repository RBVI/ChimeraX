    Fetch AlphaMissense scores for a UniProt entry specified by its accession code.
    Data is in tab separated value format.
    Create a mutation scores instance. Example URL

       https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/files/AF-Q9UNQ0-F1-aa-substitutions.csv

    It seems DeepMind didn't make the data fetchable on a per-protein basis. We can get it from the EBI alphafold
    database only it is per-fragment.  Zenodo has the original data but in a gbyte size file.
