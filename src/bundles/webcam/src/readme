On macOS 10.15 ChimeraX started from an emacs shell crashes trying to enable the webcam
apparently because it the parent app (shell or emacs) needs permission and does not have
the needed Info.plist keys NSCameraUsageDescription, NSMicrophoneUsageDescription,
causing ChimeraX to abort.  Solution is to start ChimeraX by double clicking or run
it from Terminal (which does have the needed Info.plist keys).
