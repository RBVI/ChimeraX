# A bug in pip requires that we specify prepare_metadata_for_build_editable, even
# though it should take the dist-info directory of build_editable if it's not present.
#
# So because we don't want to teach bundle builder to make a dist info dir, since setuptools
# will do it for us just fine, we'll just build the wheel and return its dist info directory
# until pip is smart enough to do it on its own.
#
# This process is negligibly slower than building the wheel, because we discard the original
# wheel for setuptools's new two-file editable wheel.
