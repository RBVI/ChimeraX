<p>
The <b>Toolbar</b> tool is the graphical interface that
organizes buttons for easy access.
The buttons can start ChimeraX tools, execute commands, execute a shortcut,
or invoke a mouse mode.
</p>
<p>
Buttons are registered via ChimeraX bundle descriptions.
They are place in a tab that corresponds to the button's category,
and are groups within the tab according to their subcategory.
<p>
At some point, the <b>Home</b> will become customizable.
