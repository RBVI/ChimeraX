def zoom(session, factor=None, frames=None, pixel_size=None):
    '''
    Move the camera toward or away from the center of rotation
    to make the objects appear bigger by a specified factor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    factor : float
       Factor by which to change apparent object size.
    frames : integer
       Perform the specified zoom over N frames.
    pixel_size : float or None
       Zoom so that the pixel size in physical units (Angstroms) is this value.
       For perspective camera modes the pixel size is set at the center of rotation depth.
       If factor is also given then it multiplies pixel size.
