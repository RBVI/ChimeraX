This directory contains code for generating a sample ChimeraX bundle
using only an installed ChimeraX application rather than the entire
ChimeraX source tree.

See https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/docs/devel/writing_bundles.html
for more details on how to build and distribute bundles.

NOTE:

setup.py.in and setup.cfg are only present for historical reasons.
They were used for building bundles before the "devel" command
was implemented.  They do offer a more powerful alternative for
experienced programmers (e.g., specifying a license file for
inclusion in the bundle), which is why we decided not to remove
them from the example.
