tasks: Task creation and monitoring
===================================

This module defines classes for tasks and their state manager.

Tasks are threads of execution that continue independently from
the main UI thread.  They can be used for web services or local
computations that potentially take a while and should be done
in the background to keep the UI interactive.

Attributes
----------
ADD_TASK : str
    Name of trigger that is fired when a new task
    registers with the state manager.

REMOVE_TASK : str
    Name of trigger that is fired when an existing task
    deregisters with the state manager.

Notes
-----

The :py:class:`Tasks` instance is a singleton per session and may be
referenced as ``session.tasks``.  It is the state manager for
'Task' instances.

A :py:class:`Task` instance represents one thread of execution
and should be registered with 'session.tasks' when
instantiated and deregistered when terminated.

Session-specific triggers are fired when tasks
are registered and deregistered.  To add and remove
:py:class:`Task` handlers, use ``session.trigger.add_handler``
and ``session.trigger.remove_handler``.
