<title>PDB Assembly Images</title>
<body>
<h1>PDB Assembly Images</h1>

<p>
August 31, 2015
</p>

<p>
The ChimeraX <i>pdbimages</i> command does batch rendering of molecular assemblies defined in
mmCIF files.  It makes an image for each assembly in each mmCIF file (*.cif suffix) in a specified directory.
</p>

<h2>
Example
</h2>

<img src="tiled.jpg" align=right>

<p>
Start ChimeraX and enter the pdbimages command specifying a directory containing mmCIF files:
</p>

<pre>
  pdbimages /tmp/mmcif_files
</pre>

<p>
This will create images for each assembly in the same directory
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ ls /tmp/mmcif_files
1A0M.cif	1EJ6_XAU.png	1M4X_5.png	
1A0M_1.png	1GOS.cif	1M4X_6.png	
1A2P.cif	1GOS_1.png	1M4X_PAU.png	
1A2P_1.png	1IDI.cif	1OJD.cif	
1A2P_2.png	1IDI_1.png	1OJD_1.png	
1A2P_3.png	1JJ2.cif	1OJD_2.png	
1EJ6.cif	1JJ2_1.png	1OJD_3.png	
1EJ6_1.png	1M4X.cif	1OJD_4.png	
1EJ6_2.png	1M4X_1.png	1OJD_5.png	
1EJ6_3.png	1M4X_2.png	
1EJ6_4.png	1M4X_3.png	
1EJ6_PAU.png	1M4X_4.png	
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The name of each assembly (typical assembly names are "1", "2", "3"...) is appended to the file mmCIF name
to produce the PNG image file name.
</p>

<h2>
Montage Image
</h2>

<p>
A tiled single image showing the assemblies can be made with the free
<a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> software package using command
to make 100 by 100 pixel tile for each assembly image.
</p>

<pre>
  montage -label "%t" *.png -geometry "100x100+0+0" tiled.jpg
</pre>

<h2>
Display Settings
</h2>

<p>
The assemblies are viewed along the -z axis of the crystallographic coordinates, which is not ideal in many cases.
They are shown with atoms as spheres, with separate colors for each chain, and ambient occlusion lighting (which
makes recessed areas dark, and allows good depth perception).
</p>

<h2>
Customizing Display Settings
</h2>

<p>
The sphere style, coloring, lighting and view point are currently set in the Python code for the
<i>pdbimages</i> command.  With some knowledge of Python this can be customized.  The code is found
in the Mac app in
</p>

<pre>
  ChimeraX.app/Contents/lib/python3.5/site-packages/chimerax/core/commands/pdbimages.py
</pre>

<p>
Some of the available commands that could be used to provide different renderings are illustrated
in the ChimeraX <a href="../quickstart/index.html">Quick Start Guide</a> and more details is
in the <a href="../devel/core/commands/commands.html">Programming Manual</a>.
</p>

<h2>
Options
</h2>

<p>
There are additional options to the <i>pdbimages</i> command.  The command is not yet documented
in the <a href="../user/index.html">User Guide</a> but is listed in the
<a href="../devel/core/commands/commands.html#pdbimages">Programming Manual</a>.
The following example makes 800 by 800 pixel images, with edge smoothing using supersampling
and logs the files processed in the specified file (useful when errors occur).
</p>

<pre>
  pdbimages /tmp/mmcif_files width 800 height 800 supersample 3 logFile /tmp/mmcif_files/log
</pre>

<h2>
Server Rendering
</h2>

<p>
The pdbimages command can be used on a Linux server without graphics and with no display by
starting Linux ChimeraX with the <i>--nogui --offscreen</i> flags and then typing the pdbimages command
to the resulting ChimeraX prompt.  This uses CPU rendering which tests showed to be approximately
60 times slower than rendering with a graphics card and display.  It is currently not possible
to use a graphics card without a display in ChimeraX.
</p>

<h2>
Performance
</h2>

<p>
On a 2012 iMac with 32 Gbytes of memory and Geforce GTX 680MX graphics (2 Gb graphics memory)
all assemblies in the PDB can be rendered in about 1 day.  Various problems are encountered.
The Mac graphics driver typically crashes after about 10,000 mmCIF files.  Also ChimeraX uses
gradually more memory, even though the mmCIF files are closed after each is rendered.  This
consumes about 1.5 Mbytes of memory per file, so 10,000 files takes 15 Gbytes of memory.
For both these reasons, it is necessary to run in batches of a few thousand files.
