Intro to ChimeraX Design
========================

There are three major components of the ChimeraX core:
the :doc:`user interface <user_interface>` modules,
the :doc:`data interface <data_interface>` modules,
and the :doc:`tool interface <modules/core/tools>` modules.
The user interface modules support the GUI and the command line interfaces,
the data interface modules support the native data types,
and the tool interface modules support common functionality
and tool registration.

In additons to the core functionality,
there are the :doc:`bundles` that use the core,
and the :doc:`applications` that use the functionality.

.. note::

    The following modules are in the process of being reorganzied.
