<h3>ChimeraX Positions Format</h3>
<p>
A ChimeraX positions file (format <b>positions</b>, filename suffix .positions)
contains one line per model, with 13 comma-separated fields: 
model name and 12 numbers,
corresponding to a 3x3 rotation matrix, and in the fourth column,
a translation vector. 
Ordering is row-by-row, such that the translation vector is 
given as the fourth, eighth, and twelfth numbers. 
This is the same matrix format as given by the
<a href="../commands/view.html#matrix"><b>view matrix</b></a> command.
Only model transformations relative to the scene are described,
not global movements, which instead reflect rotations and
translations of the camera. The command
<a href="../commands/view.html#matrix"><b>view matrix</b></a> 
can report the camera transformation.
Any model that has not been moved relative to the scene will have an
identity matrix, as in the first line of this example:

<h3>Saving and Applying Positions Files</h3>
<blockquote>

<a href="../commands/save.html"><b>save</b></a> &nbsp;<i>filename</i>
<b>models</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../commands/atomspec.html#hierarchy"><i>model-spec</i></a>

</blockquote>
<p>
The <b>models</b> option is required for both saving and opening the file.
By default, only top-level models will be included,
as normally submodels will have the same transformation as their parent.
However, the <b>childModels</b> option allows explicitly including or
applying the submodel matrices as well.
The matrices will simply be applied in order of occurrence in the file unless 
<b>matchNames true</b> is used to indicate matching the models by name instead.
