<h3>Mutation Scores Format</h3>
<p>
ChimeraX can read the results of deep mutational scanning
from a <b><i>mutation scores file</i></b>
(format name <b>ms</b>, filename suffix <b>.csv</b>) 
for visualization and analysis with the
<a href="../commands/mutationscores.html"><b>mutationscores</b></a> command.
Deep mutational scanning generally involves mutating each position in a
protein to all 20 standard amino acids and evaluating the large number
of mutants with various high-throughput assays.
The assay scores are tabulated in the file as comma-separated values.
</p><p>
The first line of the file gives the names of the columns, and subsequent 
lines give the values, for example:
</p>
<pre>
variants,wildtype,position,mutation,type,surface,surface_se,abundance,abundance_se,dox,dox_se,mtx,mtx_se,sn38,sn38_se
p.(V6A),V,6,A,missense,0.052806582,0.311071605,0.095010571,0.391069124,-0.549746993,0.43742939,0.253708238,0.317841138,-0.373043663,0.444088911
p.(V6C),V,6,C,missense,0.132574054,0.300261964,0.129538083,0.371928707,-0.012776432,0.376829305,-0.005007274,0.220479589,0.447843883,0.270068523
[...]
</pre>
<p>
The first column should describe the mutation in the 
<a href="https://hgvs-nomenclature.org/stable/recommendations/protein/substitution/" 
target="_blank">format</a>
recommended by the <a href="https://hgvs-nomenclature.org/stable/"
target="_blank">Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS)</a>,
except with 1-letter amino acid codes instead of 3-letter codes.
For example, a mutation of tyrosine 392 to alanine would be described as:
</p>
<blockquote>
p.(Y392A)
</blockquote>
<p>
Deep mutational scans often include deletions. For example,
the following denotes a deletion of valine 6:
<blockquote>
p.(V6del)
</blockquote>
<p>
ChimeraX currently offers no way to visualize the deletions and will
ignore such lines. 
</p><p>
</p><p>
Opening a mutation scores file automatically shows a 
<a href="../commands/mutationscores.html#scatterplot">scatter plot</a> 
of the mutants with the first two scores as the axes.
The menus below the plot can be used
to change which scores are plotted and for which mutation set.
</p><p>
Opening a mutation scores file automatically associates the data with a
structure chain open in ChimeraX, if its sequence and residue numbering
match that in the file.  However, if more than one matching chain is present,
the <a href="../commands/open.html#local"><b>open</b></a> command
<a href="../commands/open.html#chain"><b>chain</b></a> option
can be used to specify which to use.
Alternatively, the scores can be associated with a structure later with the
<a href="../commands/mutationscores.html#structure"><b>mutationscores
structure</b></a> command.
