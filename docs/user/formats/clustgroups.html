<h3>Clustal Conservation Groups</h3>
<p>
The Clustal ALN sequence-alignment format includes characters symbolizing
degree of conservation in a column.
These can be shown in the
<a href="../tools/sequenceviewer.html#settings-headers"><b>Conservation</b>
header</a> of an alignment in the
<a href="../tools/sequenceviewer.html"><b>Sequence Viewer</b></a>.
</p><p>
Positions where every residue is the same type (complete identity)
are marked with an asterisk (*).
</p><p>
Positions where one of the following <b>strong</b> groups is fully conserved are
marked with a colon (:).
</p><blockquote><pre>STA
NEQK
NHQK
NDEQ
QHRK
MILV
MILF
HY
FYW
</pre></blockquote>
Positions where one of the following <b>weak</b> groups is fully conserved are
marked with a period (.).
<blockquote><pre>CSA
ATV
SAG
STNK
STPA
SGND
SNDEQK
NDEQHK
NEQHRK
FVLIM
HFY
</pre></blockquote>
The groups are defined using the PAM250 matrix; scores within the strong
groups are &gt; 0.5 and scores within the weak groups are positive but &le; 0.5.
<p></p><p>
Other positions are not marked with any character.
