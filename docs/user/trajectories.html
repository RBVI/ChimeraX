<h3>Trajectories, Model Series, Volume Series</h3>
<p>
A <b><i>trajectory</i></b> is an ordered series of atomic coordinate sets,
or &ldquo;frames,&rdquo; opened as a single model.
Although the coordinate sets are in a specific order, the data need not be
a time series; for example, it could be an <b><i>ensemble</i></b>
for which the order is not meaningful.
Only one frame of a trajectory is shown at a time.
A trajectory can be played back with the
<a href="commands/coordset.html"><b>coordset</b></a> command,
the associated <a href="commands/coordset.html#slider">slider interface</a>,
or the <b>play coordinates</b> 
<a href="commands/ui.html#mousemode">mouse mode</a>
<a href="tools/mousemodes.html" title="Mouse Modes for Right Button...">
<img class="icon" border=1 src="tools/mouse-icons/coordset.png"></a>,
and saved to a file with <a href="commands/save.html"><b>save</b></a>.
If <a href="commands/surface.html">molecular surface</a> calculations
make playback slow, it may be necessary to use the surface option
<a href="commands/surface.html#options"><b>update false</b></a>.

Atomic trajectories can be created by 
<a href="commands/morph.html">morphing</a> or by opening files
from other programs. Details for opening files depend on the file format:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A multi-model file in mmCIF or PDB format can be opened as a trajectory
by using the command <a href="commands/open.html#local"><b>open</b></a> with
<b>coordsets true</b> (default <b>false</b>).
<li>A trajectory can be read from any of several 
<a href="commands/open.html#trajectory">trajectory coordinate formats</a>
by <i>first</i> opening a structure (<i>e.g.</i> from a PDB file) 
containing the same set of atoms as the trajectory, and then opening the
the coordinate file by using <a href="commands/open.html#local"><b>open</b></a> 
with the <a href="commands/open.html#structureModel"><b>structureModel</b></a>
option to specify the already-open atomic structure.
The structure is needed to supply the topology, or bonding pattern,
as it is not included in the coordinate file.
<li>If a PSF
<a href="commands/open.html#trajtop">trajectory topology file</a> is
available, however, it can be opened using the menu (<b>File... Open</b>) 
and the user will be prompted to open the corresponding
<a href="commands/open.html#trajtop">trajectory coordinate file</a>.
A PSF file can also be opened by using
<a href="commands/open.html#local"><b>open</b></a> command with the
the <a href="commands/open.html#coords"><b>coords</b></a> option to specify 
the <a href="commands/open.html#trajtop">trajectory coordinate file</a>.
</ul>
<p>
The number of coordinate sets in a trajectory
can be reported with the command <a href="commands/info.html"><b>info</b></a>.

A <b><i>model series</i></b> is an ordered series of models.
A model series can be played back with the
<a href="commands/mseries.html"><b>mseries</b></a> command
or the associated <a href="commands/mseries.html#slider">slider interface</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="vseries"></a>
A <b><i>volume series</i></b> is an ordered series of
<a href="tools/volumeviewer.html">volume data</a> sets (maps).
The maps in a single series must be of the same size 
(number of grid points in each dimension).
Volume data can be opened as a series with
<a href="commands/open.html"><b>open</b></a>,
employing filename wildcard symbols or globbing as needed to specify
multiple files in a single command; 3D TIFF images and
<a href="commands/save.html#chimap">Chimera map</a> files 
containing five or more
same-sized maps are automatically treated as series, if possible,
whereas other sets of same-sized maps can be designated as series
with the <a href="commands/open.html#vseries"><b>vseries</b></a>
option of <a href="commands/open.html"><b>open</b></a>.
If a volume series is opened by choosing multiple TIFF files 
in the dialog from menu: <a href="menu.html#file"><b>File... Open</b></a>,
the sort order in the dialog may define the temporal order. 
Volume series can be played back with the 
<a href="commands/vseries.html"><b>vseries</b></a> command,
the associated <a href="commands/vseries.html#slider">slider interface</a>,
or the <b>play map series</b>
<a href="commands/ui.html#mousemode">mouse mode</a>
<a href="tools/mousemodes.html" title="Mouse Modes for Right Button...">
<img class="icon" border=1 src="tools/mouse-icons/vseries.png"></a>.
<a href="markers.html">Markers</a> placed on volume series data are assigned a
<a href="attributes.html#atom"><b>frame</b> attribute</a> with value
indicating the associated time step within the series.
