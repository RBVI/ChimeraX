<h3>Trajectories, Model Series, Volume Series</h3>
<p>
A <b><i>trajectory</i></b></a> is an ordered series of atomic coordinate sets,
or &ldquo;frames,&rdquo; opened as a single model.
Although the coordinate sets are in a specific order, the data need not be
a time series; for example, it could be an <b><i>ensemble</i></b>
for which the order is not meaningful.
Only one frame of a trajectory is shown at a time.
Different frames can be shown or played back sequentially with the 
<a href="commands/coordset.html"><b>coordset</b></a> command, or interactively
with a <a href="commands/coordset.html#slider">slider interface</a>.
A multi-model file in mmCIF or PDB format can be opened as a trajectory
by using the command <a href="commands/open.html"><b>open</b></a> with
<b>coordsets true</b> (default <b>false</b>).
A trajectory can also be read from any of several 
<a href="commands/open.html#trajectory">trajectory formats</a>
or created with the <a href="commands/morph.html"><b>morph</b></a> command,
and saved to a file with <a href="commands/save.html"><b>save</b></a>.
The number of coordinate sets in a trajectory
can be reported with the command <a href="commands/info.html"><b>info</b></a>.

A <b><i>model series</i></b> is an ordered series of models.
A model series can be played back with the
<a href="commands/mseries.html"><b>mseries</b></a> command
or the associated <a href="commands/mseries.html#slider">slider interface</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="vseries"></a>
A <b><i>volume series</i></b> is an ordered series of
<a href="tools/volumeviewer.html">volume data</a> sets (maps).
The maps in a single series must be of the same size 
(number of grid points in each dimension).
Volume data can be opened as a series with
<a href="commands/open.html"><b>open</b></a>,
employing filename wildcard symbols or globbing as needed to specify
multiple files in a single command; 3D TIFF images and
<a href="commands/save.html#chimap">Chimera map</a> files 
containing five or more
same-sized maps are automatically treated as series, if possible,
whereas other sets of same-sized maps can be designated as series
with the <b>vseries</b> option of <a href="commands/open.html"><b>open</b></a>.
Volume series can be played back with the 
<a href="commands/vseries.html"><b>vseries</b></a> command
or the associated <a href="commands/vseries.html#slider">slider interface</a>.
