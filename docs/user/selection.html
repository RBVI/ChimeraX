<h3>Selection</h3>
<p>
A <b><i>selection</i></b> is a set of items (atoms, residues, models)
chosen by the user that:
<ul>
<li>is highlighted with green outlines in the graphics window
<li>marks the items for subsequent operations:
  <ul>
  <li>can be <a href="commands/atomspec.html#builtin">specified</a> 
  as <b>sel</b>, <b>selAtoms</b>, <b>selMaps</b> in many commands, for example: 
  <b><a href="commands/style.html">style</a> sel stick</b>
  <li>indicates scope of action of
  <a href="tools/moldisplay.html"><b>Molecule Display</b></a> icons
  and <a href="tools/densitymaps.html"><b>Density Maps</b></a> icons
  </ul>
<li>can be created:
  <ul>
  <li>with the mouse in the graphics window
  (see <a href="commands/mousemode.html"><b>mousemode</b></a>), by default:
    <ul>
    <li>Ctrl-click to start selection (replace)
    <li>Shift-Ctrl-click to add/subtract (toggle)
    </ul>
  <li>with the <a href="commands/select.html"><b>select</b></a> command
  <li>by dragging a box around residues in an associated
  <a href="tools/sequenceviewer.html">sequence</a>
  <li>with various other commands and tools
  </ul>
<a name="cascade"></a>
<li>can be broadened with the up arrow key
or command <a href="commands/select.html#modify"><b>select up</b></a>,
and subsequently narrowed with the down arrow key
or <a href="commands/select.html#modify"><b>select down</b></a>,
within the <b><i>selection cascade</i></b>:
  <ul>
  <li>atom &harr; residue &harr; protein secondary structure element 
  (helix, strand, or coil) &harr; all atoms with same chain ID &harr; 
  whole model &harr; all models
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Selecting a standard (atom-associated)
<a href="commands/surface.html">molecular surface</a>
automatically also selects the atoms used to define it.
If the whole surface model is selected, all of the atoms used to define
that surface are selected, even atoms that are completely buried.
Typically all of the atoms in a biopolymer chain are used
to define a surface, but other sets of atoms can be specified with the
<a href="commands/surface.html"><b>surface</b></a> command.
If a surface patch is selected 
<a href="commands/mousemode.html">with the mouse</a>,
only the atom(s) directly contributing to that patch are selected.
Conversely, selecting an atom selects its surface patch(es).
</p><p>
Nonmolecular surfaces can be selected as a whole. 
Selectable objects such as atoms and bonds under or behind a 
<a href="tools/volumeviewer.html">volume</a> surface 
can be selected with the mouse if the surface is transparent 
(not completely opaque) or shown as mesh.
If the mouseclick is on a surface region that does not overlie another 
selectable object, however, the surface model will be selected.

<h3>Selection vs. Direct Specification in Commands</h3>
<p>
Command-line <a href="commands/atomspec.html">target specification</a> strings,
including <a href="commands/atomspec.html#combinations">logical operations</a>
(and/or/not) and <a href="commands/atomspec.html#zones">zones</a>, can be given
directly in commands, bypassing selection.
However, <a href="commands/atomspec.html">target specification</a> may include
<b>sel</b>, <b>selAtoms</b>, and <b>selMaps</b> to indicate the current selection,
and selections are useful in other contexts,
such as defining the scope of action when an icon is clicked.
