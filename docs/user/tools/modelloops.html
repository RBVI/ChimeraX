<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Model Loops</h3>
<p>
<b>Model Loops</b> is an interface to the
<a href="https://www.salilab.org/modeller/" target="_blank">Modeller</a>
program running on a web service hosted by the
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Overview/index.html" target="_blank">UCSF
RBVI</a>. The command-line implementation is
<a href="../commands/modeller.html#loops"><b>modeller loops</b></a>.

<b>Model Loops</b> builds parts of a protein without using a template.
Missing segments can be built <i>de novo</i>, or existing segments refined 
by generating additional possible conformations. 
Parts that need building or refinement are often loop regions. 
The protein sequence to be modeled is the <b><i>target</i></b>.
</p><p>
Modeller is developed by the 
<a href="https://www.salilab.org" target="_blank">&Scaron;ali Lab</a>,
and its users should cite:

The following are required for each chain to be modeled:
<ol>
<li>The atomic structure of at least part of the protein, open in ChimeraX.
<br><br>
<li>A sequence that includes the segments to be filled in or refined, open
in the <a href="sequenceviewer.html"><b>Sequence Viewer</b></a>
(as a single sequence or within a multiple sequence alignment) and
<a href="../tools/sequenceviewer.html#association">associated</a>
with the protein structure.
<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="10px"><tr>
<td class="shaded">
The target sequence can be taken from the structure metadata
(and shown for a specific chain using the menu:
<b>Tools... Sequence... Show Sequence Viewer</b>),
or <a href="open.html#fetch">fetched</a>
from <a href="https://www.uniprot.org" target="_blank">UniProt</a>,
or opened from a <a href="open.html#sequence">file</a>.
The sequence must be the same as the sequence of the structure, except that 
differences are permitted within the segments to be filled in or refined,
as well as any
<a href="#adjacentFlexible">adjacent positions designated as flexible</a>;
the residue types shown in the
<a href="sequenceviewer.html"><b>Sequence Viewer</b></a>
will be used to model those segments.
Accuracy can be quite high for shorter loops, but falls off rapidly with length
(&gt;50% poor predictions for segments with 10+ residues including the
<a href="#adjacentFlexible">flexible positions</a>, see Table 1 in 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2144714/"

<b>9</b>(9):1753 (2000)).

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="10px"><tr>
<td class="shaded">
Modeling multiple different chains in a complex
requires a separate sequence alignment for each unique chain. 
For example, simultaneously modeling the &alpha; and &beta; chains
within an &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub> tetramer requires both 
&alpha; subunits to be <a href="sequenceviewer.html#association">associated</a>
with one alignment containing the target &alpha; sequence, and both 
&beta; subunits to be <a href="sequenceviewer.html#association">associated</a>
with another alignment containing the target &beta; sequence.
To instead model only one &alpha;&beta; dimer within the tetramer, 
the other two structure chains should be
<a href="sequenceviewer.html#association">dissociated</a> from the sequences.

</p>
<h3>Startup and Input</h3>
<p>
<b>Model Loops</b>
can be opened from the <b>Sequence</b> or <b>Structure Prediction</b>
section of the <b>Tools</b> menu and manipulated like other panels
(<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
It is also implemented as the 
<a href="../commands/modeller.html#loops"><b>modeller loops</b></a>
command.
</p><p>
One sequence alignment per target should be chosen (highlighted) 
in the top section of the dialog. Immediately below, for each chosen alignment,
the name of the target sequence should be selected from the pull-down menu.
</p><p>
<b>Basic</b> settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Number of models</b> (initial default <b>5</b>, maximum 1000)
&ndash; number of models to create
<li><b>Modeller license key</b>
&ndash; see <a href="#key">above</a>
<li><b>Model</b> &ndash; which parts of the protein sequence to build or refine:
  <ul>
  <li><b>all missing structure</b> (initial default)
&ndash; all missing segments of the structure relative to the
<a href="../tools/sequenceviewer.html#association">associated</a> sequence
  <li><b>internal missing structure</b>
&ndash; all non-terminal missing segments of the structure relative to the
<a href="../tools/sequenceviewer.html#association">associated</a> sequence
  <li><b>active sequence-viewer region</b>
&ndash; the current <a href="sequenceviewer.html#active">active region</a>
within the
<a href="../tools/sequenceviewer.html#association">associated</a> sequence
  </ul>
<a name="adjacentFlexible"></a>
<li><b>Adjacent flexible residues</b> (initial default <b>1</b>)
&ndash; how many additional residues next to each end of the missing segment or
specified region to remodel relative to the input structure.
If the residues designated as flexible are different types in the sequence
than in the structure, the residue types in the sequence will be used.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Advanced</b> settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Use fast/approximate mode (produces only one model)</b>
(initial default <b>off</b>)
&ndash; use fast/approximate mode (~3 times faster) to get a rough idea of
model appearance or to confirm that the alignment is reasonable.
This mode does not randomize the starting structure (generates only a
single model) and performs very little optimization of the target function.
<li><b>Protocol</b> &ndash; which loop-modeling protocol to use:
  <ul>
  <li><b>standard</b> (initial default)
  <li><b>DOPE</b>
&ndash; Discrete Optimized Protein Energy score (DOPE, see
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17075131" target="_blank">Shen
and Sali</a>, <i>Protein Sci</i> <b>15</b>:2507 (2006)) with Lennard-Jones
potential and GB/SA implicit solvent interaction. The DOPE protocol
generally gives higher-quality results than the standard protocol,
but is more computationally
expensive and more prone to calculation failure, potentially
resulting in fewer models than requested.
  <li><b>DOPE-HR</b> &ndash; the same as DOPE, except with higher precision
  </ul>
<li><b>Temporary folder location (optional)</b>
&ndash; use the specified location for temporary files; 
otherwise, a location will be generated automatically
</ul>
<p>
<b>Model Loops</b> settings including the 
<a href="#key">license key</a> are automatically saved in the
<a href="../preferences.html">preferences</a>.
Other than the license key, the remembered settings apply only to the GUI;
the command defaults are not changed.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Cancel</b> simply dismisses the dialog, whereas <b>OK</b>
sends information to the web service and initiates the calculation.
</p><p>
The <a href="modeller.html#output">results dialog</a>
is the same as described for
<a href="modeller.html"><b>Modeller Comparative</b></a>.
