<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Add Hydrogens</h3>
<p>
<b>Add Hydrogens</b> adds hydrogen atoms to atomic models, as well as
OXT atoms where missing from peptide C-termini. 
The corresponding command is <a href="../commands/addh.html"><b>addh</b></a>.

<a href="buildstructure.html"><b>Build Structure</b></a>,
<a href="checkwaters.html"><b>Check Waters</b></a>
</p><p>
<b>Add Hydrogens</b> can be opened from the 
<b>Structure Editing</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu and 
manipulated like other panels (<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
<p></p>
The atomic model(s) to protonate should be chosen from the
<b>Add hydrogens to:</b> list in the dialog.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Consider each model in isolation from all others</b>
&ndash; whether hydrogen placement should be affected by atoms within the same
model only. Otherwise, other models in the vicinity (except submodels of
the same model) may affect hydrogen placement, regardless of whether they
were chosen for hydrogen addition.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="method"></a>
The <b>Method</b> for adding hydrogens can be:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>steric only</b> &ndash; based on
<a href="../atomtypes.html">atom types</a> and clash avoidance
<li><b>also consider H-bonds (slower)</b> (default) &ndash; based on
<a href="../atomtypes.html">atom types</a>, clash avoidance,
and hydrogen bond formation.
Considering H-bonds increases the calculation time.
Although hydrogens are placed to avoid clashes and form hydrogen bonds
where possible, they are not energy-minimized, and
a globally optimal network in terms of the number of H-bonds or
total H-bonding energy is not necessarily found.
</ul>

<p>
Clicking the <b>Options</b> button shows/hides additional options:
</p><p>
<b>Protonation states</b> of certain ionizable sidechains can be specified.
By default, if amino acids have standard residue names, each histidine
sidechain will be protonated based on its local environment,
whereas the sidechains of other residue types will be assigned
<a href="#states">protonation states</a> 
reasonable at physiological pH, regardless of the local
environment: negative glutamic acid and aspartic acid,
positive lysine and arginine, and neutral cysteine and tyrosine.
Alternative protonation states of histidine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid,
lysine, and cysteine can be specified interactively or
with special residue names in the input coordinate file:
<ul>
<li>Choices for <a name="hisprot"><b>histidine</b></a>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Residue-name-based</b> (default)
  &ndash; residue names will be used to determine which
  histidine sidechain nitrogens should be protonated: the &delta;-nitrogen
  in residues named HID, the &epsilon;-nitrogen in HIE, and both
  nitrogens in HIP. Residues named HIS will be treated as unspecified,
  and may end up with either or both sidechain nitrogens protonated,
  depending on the <a href="#method">method</a> and the local environment.
  <li><b>Unspecified (determined by method)</b>
  &ndash; regardless of which of the
  names above are used for histidine residues, all will be treated as
  unspecified, and may end up with either or both sidechain nitrogens
  protonated,
  depending on the <a href="#method">method</a> and the local environment.
  </ul>
<li>Choices for <b>aspartic acid</b>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Residue-name-based</b> (default)
  &ndash; residue names will be used to determine sidechain charge state:
  ASP negatively charged and ASH neutral, OD2-protonated
  <li><b>Charged</b> &ndash; negatively charged
  </ul>
<li>Choices for <b>cysteine</b>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Residue-name-based</b> (default)
  &ndash; residue names will be used to determine sidechain charge state:
  CYS unspecified and CYM negatively charged
  <li><b>Unspecified (determined by method)</b> 
  &ndash; regardless of which of the
  names above are used for cysteine residues, all will be treated as
  unspecified and the sidechain sulfur may be protonated or not
  depending on the <a href="#method">method</a> and the local environment.
  </ul>
<li>Choices for <b>glutamic acid</b>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Residue-name-based</b> (default)
  &ndash; residue names will be used to determine sidechain charge state:
  GLU negatively charged and GLH neutral, OE2-protonated
  <li><b>Charged</b> &ndash; negatively charged
  </ul>
<li>Choices for <b>lysine</b>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Residue-name-based</b> (default)
  &ndash; residue names will be used to determine sidechain charge state:
  LYS positively charged and LYN neutral
  <li><b>Charged</b> &ndash; positively charged
  </ul>
</ul>
Further options:
<ul>
<li><b>Do not protonate electronegative atom X within</b>
[<b><i>distance</i></b>] <b>&Aring; of metal M 
if X-H-M angle would be >120&deg;</b> 
(default <b>3.95</b> &Aring;)
<li><b>Use idealized template to guess atom types in nonstandard residues</b>
(default <b>off</b>)
&ndash; whether to use idealized
coordinates to discern <a href="../atomtypes.html">atom types</a>
in nonstandard residues, instead of their actual coordinates in the structure.
The idealized coordinates are looked up by residue name
in the <a href="https://www.wwpdb.org/data/ccd" target="_blank">PDB
Chemical Component Dictionary</a>. This option is useful
for structures with poorly (structurally) determined ligands that could be
mis-typed, potentially causing addition of the wrong number of hydrogens or
hydrogens in incorrect positions.
</ul>
<p>
Clicking <b>OK</b> adds hydrogens and dismisses the dialog, while
<b>Cancel</b> merely dismisses the dialog. Clicking <b>Help</b>
shows this page in the <a href="helpviewer.html"><b>Help Viewer</b></a>.
</p><p>
The positions of pre-existing atoms are not changed, but
any lone pairs and atoms of unidentifiable element are deleted.
Hydrogens are named in accordance with the PDB standard, if possible, and
positioned to produce the expected <a href="#bondlengths">bond lengths</a>.
An attempt is made to preserve coloring schemes, coloring the added hydrogens
<a href="../commands/colortables.html#element">by element</a> (white)
and/or to match their bond partners.
</p><p>
The <a href="../radii.html">default VDW radii</a>
of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms
depend on whether hydrogen atoms are present;
thus, adding hydrogens will change the VDW radii of some atoms.

<h3>Protonation States</h3>
<p>
<b>Add Hydrogens</b> aims to generate
protonation states reasonable at physiological pH.
For example, hydrogens are not added to the phosphodiester moieties
of DNA and RNA.  By default,
aspartic acid and glutamic acid sidechains are assumed to be
negatively charged, arginine and lysine sidechains positively charged.
Two chemical moieties are treated as ambiguous at biological pH:
</p>
<ul>
<li>imidazoles such as histidine sidechains; histidine protonation states
can be <a href="#hisprot">specified by the user</a> (by changing residue
names beforehand with <a href="../commands/setattr.html"><b>setattr</b></a>
or by text-editing the input structure file)
or guessed by the <a href="#method">method</a>
<li>terminal phosphates (the third ionization);
if one P&ndash;O bond is at least 0.05 &Aring; longer than the others
around that same phosphorus atom, that oxygen will be protonated
</ul>
<p>
Potentially ambiguous or rare (shifted-pKa) protonation states,
especially in binding sites and nonstandard residues,
should be verified and corrected as needed.  For example,
extra hydrogens can be <a href="../commands/delete.html">deleted</a>,
and <a href="../atomtypes.html">atom types</a> can be edited
(before hydrogen addition)
with <a href="../commands/setattr.html"><b>setattr</b></a>
or <a href="buildstructure.html"><b>Build Structure</b></a>.
</p><p>
<a name="termini"></a>
Residues at the ends of connected peptide chains are inspected
to determine whether
they are real termini, based on any SEQRES information in the input PDB
file (or the mmCIF equivalent) and the presence or absence of additional
chains with the same IDs.  Real N-termini are assumed to be
positively charged (<sup>+</sup>H<sub>3</sub>N&ndash;) and real C-termini are
assumed to be negatively charged (&ndash;CO<sub>2</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>).
If a C-terminal carboxylate is missing an oxygen (OXT), it will be added.
End residues that are not real termini are terminated like other chain-internal
residues, with N(H)&ndash; and &ndash;C(=O). The position of the
N-end &ldquo;amide&rdquo; hydrogen in such cases is not fully determined by the
positions of the existing atoms; <b>Add Hydrogens</b> places this hydrogen
to produce a &phi; angle equal to that of the subsequent residue.

<h3>Recommended Alternative: Reduce</h3>
<p>
When a more intensive approach is desired, the program
<a href="https://kinemage-site.herokuapp.com/software/reduce/"
target="_blank"><b>Reduce</b></a> provided as part of
<a href="http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/" 
target="_blank"><b>MolProbity</b></a> is a good alternative.
It places hydrogens to optimize local H-bonding networks
and avoid steric overlaps, while flipping certain sidechains
180&deg; as deemed appropriate to fulfill these criteria.
Asparagine and glutamine sidechains may be flipped to switch their
terminal N and O atoms, and the imidazole ring of histidine may
be flipped to switch N and C identities.  The protonation state of
histidine is adjusted based on the local environment.
The method is described in:
