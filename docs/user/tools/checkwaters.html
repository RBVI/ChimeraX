<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Check Waters</h3>
<p>
<b>Check Waters</b> lists the waters in an atomic structure and allows
inspecting them individually for H-bonds and visual agreement with 
a corresponding density map (if any) opened separately and shown with 
<a href="volumeviewer.html"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>.

<p>
<b>Check Waters</b> can be started 
from the <b>Structure Analysis</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu.
An initial dialog will appear for choosing the model of interest 
from a menu of the current atomic models.
Clicking <b>Apply</b> (to keep that dialog up) or <b>OK</b> (to dismiss it) 
will open another panel with a list of the waters in the structure.
</p><p>
For each water, the list gives the number of <b>H-bonds</b>,
and if a corresponding density map was open before <b>Check Waters</b>
was started, the <b>Density</b> at atom positions summed over the atoms
in the residue: usually just one oxygen, but including hydrogens if present.
The list can be sorted on any column by clicking the column heading.
</p><p>
<a name="chosen"></a>
One or more waters can be <b><i>chosen</i></b> from the list
by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button;
<b>Ctrl</b>-click (or <b>command</b>-click if using a Mac)
toggles whether a water is chosen.  
Choosing waters in the list automatically
<a href="../selection.html">selects</a> them and focuses the view
on their near vicinities (atoms within 4&Aring;), slicing the structure
by placing near/far <a href="../commands/clip.html">clipping</a> planes.
</p><p>
<a name="hbonds"></a>
H-bonds are displayed as
<a href="../pseudobonds.html">pseudobonds</a> unless
<b>Show H-bonds</b> is turned off (initial default <b>on</b>).
Clicking <b>H-bond parameters</b> opens a separate dialog with
several of the calculation options that also appear in the
<a href="hbonds.html"><b>H-Bonds</b></a> tool;
clicking <b>Apply</b> recalculates the H-bonds accordingly.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking <b>Delete</b> deletes the chosen waters. 
Caution: deletion cannot be undone except by reopening the original structure.
<li><b>Go to next water in list after Delete</b>
&ndash; whether deleting a single water should automatically choose 
the next one in the list; either way, deleting multiple waters 
at the same time will not choose anything automatically.
<li>Clicking <b>Unclip</b> turns off 
<a href="../commands/clip.html">clipping</a>
to allow viewing the entire depth of the structure.
</ul>
