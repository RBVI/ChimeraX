<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: ViewDock</h3>
<p>
<b>ViewDock</b> is a tool for the interactive analysis of
molecular docking results.
Users can click through a list of docked compounds (or different
poses of the same compound) to view them individually in the context
of a binding site. Results can be sorted, rated, and saved.

H-ras (the protein part of PDB entry

with <a href="../commands/open.html#file-table"><b>format swissdock</b></a>;

two commands or a single command)
</li></ul>
<p>
By default
(<a href="../commands/open.html#local"><b>open</b></a> command with
<a href="../commands/open.html#showTool"><b>showTool true</b></a>),
opening a file that contains multiple docked ligands or ligand poses 
will automatically start the <b>ViewDock</b> interface. 
Alternatively, one or more such files can be opened with
<a href="../commands/open.html#showTool"><b>showTool false</b></a>,
and subsequently the <b>ViewDock</b> tool can be started
from the <b>Binding Analysis</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu
</p><p>
The docking results and scores (if any) are listed in a 
<a href="#table">table</a>
that can be manipulated like other panels in ChimeraX 
(<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
</p>

<a name="table"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: ViewDock</a>]
</p>
<h3>ViewDock Table</h3>
<p>
In the table of docking results, the rows are different compounds or
different positions of a compound, and the columns show additional data
read from the input, typically including compound names
and docking scores. The structures and their data are saved in
<a href="../commands/save.html#session">sessions</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="chosen"></a>
One or more rows can be <b><i>chosen</i></b> (highlighted) in the list
by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button;
<b>Ctrl</b>-click (or <b>command</b>-click if using a Mac)
toggles whether a row is chosen. Choosing rows displays the corresponding
compounds and hides the others. 
Choosing a single compound (row) displays all of its descriptor values 
in the lower part of the panel and allows setting its <b>Compound Rating</b> as
<b>good</b>, <b>maybe</b>, or <b>bad</b> or <b>(unrated)</b>.
If multiple compounds are chosen, their descriptors are not shown, 
but their ratings can be changed collectively.
The ratings can also be adjusted with <a href="#hotkeys">hotkeys</a>.
Below each rating button is a <b>hide</b> checkbox, which if activated
will hide all of the corresponding compounds in both the <b>ViewDock</b> table
and the graphics window. The hidden models will still be listed in the 
<a href="modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>.
</p><p>
When the <b>ViewDock</b> dialog has the mouse focus and a single
compound is shown (it may be necessary to click on the row for that compound
after interacting with other windows), pressing the keyboard 
down (up) arrow key chooses the next (previous) 
compound in the list. The list can also be navigated with the 
<b>next docked</b> <a href="../commands/ui.html#mousemode">mouse mode</a>
<a href="mousemodes.html" title="Mouse Modes for Right Button...">
<img class="icon" border="1" src="mouse-icons/nextdocking.png" alt="computer generated image"></a>.
</p><p>
The first two columns in the table are generated automatically:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ID</b> &ndash; model number
</li><li><b>Rating</b> &ndash; whether unrated or assigned as
<b>good</b>, <b>maybe</b>, or <b>bad</b> by the user
</li></ul>
<p>
Any additional columns that appear when <b>ViewDock</b> is first started
reflect information read from the input file(s).
Clicking a column header sorts by the values in that column,
and dragging it left or right allows reordering the columns.
Checkboxes under the list of compounds specify which columns of
information to include in the table of hits, with buttons:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>All</b> &ndash; show all columns
</li><li><b>Default</b> &ndash; restore the previously saved
<a href="../preferences.html#other">preference</a> for which columns are shown
</li><li><b>Standard</b> &ndash; use &ldquo;factory default&rdquo; set of
initially displayed columns
</li><li><b>Set Default</b> &ndash; save the currently shown set as a
user <a href="../preferences.html#other">preference</a>
</li><li><b>Toggle Controls</b> &ndash; show/hide the checkbox section
</li></ul>
<p>
<a name="buttons"></a>
Buttons above the table:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>HBonds</b> 
&ndash; calculate and add a column for
the number of H-bonds between each compound and all other atoms
(excluding the other docked compounds) using the
<a href="hbonds.html"><b>H-Bonds</b></a> tool
<!-- 
hbonds docked-models restrict all-other-atomic-models & (main | ligand) reveal true
-->
</li><li><b>Clashes</b> 
&ndash; calculate and add a column for
the number of clashes between each compound and all other atoms
(excluding the other docked compounds) using the
<a href="clashes.html"><b>Clashes</b></a> tool
<!-- 
clashes docked-models restrict all-other-atomic-models & (main | ligand) reveal true
-->
<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="8px" cellspacing="0px" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="shaded">
For the purposes of identifying H-bonds and clashes,
<a href="../commands/atomspec.html#surfcats">ligand</a> residues in the
receptor model not meant to be considered should be deleted beforehand.
In addition, any models other than the receptor and its docked compounds
should be spatially separated from them or closed.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</blockquote>
</li><li><b>Save...</b> save all compound structures listed in the table
and their descriptors (including ratings) to a Mol2 file; the file can be
reopened later for further analysis with <b>ViewDock</b>
</li><li><b>Close</b> &ndash; close the currently
<a href="#chosen">chosen</a> compounds
and remove their rows from the table
</li></ul>

<a name="hotkeys"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: ViewDock</a>]
</p>
<h3>ViewDock Hotkeys</h3>
<p>
Compound-rating hotkeys can be activated by checking <b>Hotkeys active</b> in
the <b>ViewDock</b> dialog's <a href="../window.html#context-menu">context menu</a>.
With hotkeys enabled and mouse focus in the
<b>ViewDock</b> dialog or the 3D graphics window:
</p>
<ul>
<li>typing <b>g/m/b/u</b> will rate the currently 
<a href="#chosen">chosen</a> compounds as good/maybe/bad/(unrated) 
</li><li><b>down (up) arrow</b> keys navigate the table by
<a href="#chosen">choosing</a> the next (previous) compound,
unless mouse focus is in the 3D graphics window and there is a
<a href="../selection.html">selection</a>, in which case they
navigate the <a href="../selection.html#cascade">selection hierarchy</a>
</li><li><b>Esc</b> turns off the <b>ViewDock</b> hotkeys;
they can also be disabled (or re-enabled) using the 
<b>ViewDock</b> <a href="../window.html#context-menu">context menu</a>
</li></ul>
<p>
<b>ViewDock</b> hotkey status is remembered across ChimeraX sessions in the user
<a href="../preferences.html#other">preferences</a>.
