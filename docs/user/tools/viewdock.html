<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: ViewDock</h3>
<p>
<b>ViewDock</b> is a tool for the interactive analysis of
molecular docking results.
Users can click through a list of docked compounds (or different
poses of the same compound) to view them individually in the context
of a binding site. Results can be sorted, rated, and saved.
See also: 
an <a href="../formats/dock4.mol2">example file</a> of compounds docked to 
H-ras (the protein part of PDB entry

modified PDB format (<a href="../commands/open.html#local"><b>open</b></a>
with <a href="../commands/open.html#file-table"><b>format swissdock</b></a>;
the ligand and receptor files can be opened in either order, and with 
two commands or a single command)
</ul>
<p>
By default
(<a href="../commands/open.html#local"><b>open</b></a> command with
<a href="../commands/open.html#showTool"><b>showTool true</b></a>),
opening a file that contains multiple docked ligands or ligand poses 
will automatically start the <b>ViewDock</b> interface. 
Alternatively, one or more such files can be opened with
<a href="../commands/open.html#showTool"><b>showTool false</b></a>,
and subsequently the <b>ViewDock</b> tool can be started
from the <b>Binding Analysis</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu
</p><p>
The docking results and scores (if any) are listed in a 
<a href="#table">table</a>
that can be manipulated like other panels in ChimeraX 
(<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
</p>

<a name="table"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: ViewDock</a>]
</p>
<h3>ViewDock Table</h3>
<p>
In the table of docking results, the rows are different compounds or
different positions of a compound, and the columns show additional data
read from the input, typically including compound names
and docking scores. The structures and their data are saved in
<a href="../commands/save.html#session">sessions</a>.
</p><p>
One or more rows can be <b><i>chosen</i></b> (highlighted) in the list
by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button;
<b>Ctrl</b>-click (or <b>command</b>-click if using a Mac)
toggles whether a row is chosen. 
Choosing rows displays the corresponding
ligands and hides the others.
</p><p>
The first two columns in the table are generated automatically:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ID</b> &ndash; model number
<li><b>Rating</b> &ndash; rating on a scale of 1 to 3 (click to change)
</ul>
<p>
Any additional columns that appear when <b>ViewDock</b> is first started
reflect information read from the input file(s).
Clicking a column header sorts by the values in that column.
Checkboxes in the bottom section of the panel control which columns of
information are shown in the table of hits, with buttons:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>All</b> &ndash; show all columns
<li><b>Default</b> &ndash; restore the previously saved
<a href="../preferences.html#other">preference</a> for which columns are shown
<li><b>Standard</b> &ndash; use &ldquo;factory default&rdquo; set of
initially displayed columns
<li><b>Set Default</b> &ndash; save the currently shown set as a
user <a href="../preferences.html#other">preference</a>
<li><b>Toggle Controls</b> &ndash; show/hide the checkbox section
</ul>
<p>
When the <b>ViewDock</b> dialog has the mouse focus and a single
compound is shown (it may be necessary to click on the row for that compound
after interacting with other windows),
pressing the keyboard down (up) arrow key hides the compound and shows
the next (previous) compound in the list.
All of the descriptors read from the file for that compound will be shown in
a panel at the very bottom of the dialog. The list can also be navigated with
the <b>next docked</b> <a href="../commands/ui.html#mousemode">mouse mode</a>
<a href="mousemodes.html" title="Mouse Modes for Right Button...">
<img class="icon" border=1 src="mouse-icons/nextdocking.png"></a>.
</p><p>
<a name="buttons"></a>
Buttons above the table:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>HBonds</b> 
&ndash; calculate and add a column for
the number of H-bonds between each compound and all other atoms
(excluding the other docked compounds) using the
<a href="hbonds.html"><b>H-Bonds</b></a> tool
<!-- hbonds [dock-models] restrict [other-models] reveal true interSub true -->
<li><b>Clashes</b> 
&ndash; calculate and add a column for
the number of clashes between each compound and all other atoms
(excluding the other docked compounds) using the
<a href="clashes.html"><b>Clashes</b></a> tool
<!-- clashes [dock-models] test others reveal true -->
<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="8px" cellspacing="0px" border=1><tr><td class="shaded">
Because <b><i>all</i></b> other atoms besides the docked compounds
are treated as the receptor for identifying H-bonds and clashes,
any atoms not meant to be considered (generally solvent, 
co-crystallized ligands, <i>etc.</i>) should be deleted beforehand.
In addition, any models other than the receptor and its docked compounds
should be spatially separated from them or closed.
</td></tr></table>
</blockquote>
<!--
<li><b>Save...</b> save all compound structures and descriptors 
(including current ratings) to a Mol2 file; the file can be
reopened later for further analysis with <b>ViewDock</b>
<li><b>Close</b> &ndash; close any structures with ratings no greater 
than the specified number and remove their rows from the table
