<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Color Zone</h3>
<p>
<b>Color Zone</b> colors <a href="volumeviewer.html">volume data</a> (map) 
surfaces to match nearby atoms or <a href="../markers.html">markers</a>.
A map that has been colored by zone can then be split into separate maps 
for the different zones. 
Coloring by zone is also implemented as the command
<a href="../commands/color.html#zone"><b>color zone</b></a>
(with more options than shown in this tool), and splitting as
<a href="../commands/volume.html#splitbyzone"><b>volume splitbyzone</b></a>.
For coloring by segmentation region, see
<a href="../commands/segmentation.html"><b>segmentation</b></a>.

<b>Color Zone</b> can be started 
from the <b>Volume Data</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu.
The tool window can be
<a href="../window.html#panels">moved, resized, <i>etc.</i></a>
</p><p>
The surface to color should be chosen from the list of available map models,
and the atoms to use specified as <b>selected atoms</b> (the current
<a href="../selection.html">selection</a>) or chosen from the list of 
available atomic models. All atoms of a chosen model will be used, including
ligand, solvent, <i>etc.</i>, even if they are not displayed. To use
only the biopolymer portion of a model, either the remaining atoms should
be deleted, or only those atoms <a href="../selection.html">selected</a>
and designated as <b>selected atoms</b> instead.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Color</b> colors vertices in the chosen surface
that are within the specified <b>Coloring radius</b> of any of the atoms.
When multiple atoms are within the cutoff distance,
a vertex will be colored to match the closest one.
Vertices not within the cutoff of any atom
are assigned the default surface color (single-color mode).
Each surface triangle is colored by linearly interpolating
its vertex colors. Colors are defined by red, green, blue
and opacity/transparency components.
</p><p>
The <b>Coloring radius</b> can be adjusted by moving the slider
or by typing in a new value.
The slider is logarithmic to cover a wide range of values.
If the set of atoms is changed, or if an atom is
recolored or repositioned relative to the surface,
<b>Color</b> must be clicked again to update the surface coloring.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Uncolor</b> returns the surface to its
default color (single-color mode).
</p><p>
<a name="split"></a>
<b>Split Map</b> splits the corresponding
map into separate data sets for the zones.
A data set is created for each distinct color and for the 
&ldquo;uncolored&rdquo; data (in the zone remaining when the color zones 
are subtracted from the original volume). 
Values outside the respective zones are set to zero.
The new data sets are named by appending numbers (0, 1, 2, ...)
to the name of the original map.  The number 0 is
associated with the uncolored region, whereas the other numbers
correspond to the distinct colors in an unpredictable order.
The original map is hidden but not modified.

in the <a href="helpviewer.html"><b>Help Viewer</b></a>.
