<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Measure and Color Blobs</h3>
<p>
<b>Measure and Color Blobs</b> measures individual disconnected parts
or <b><i>blobs</i></b> within a surface model.
It is also implemented as the command 
<a href="../commands/measure.html#blob"><b>measure blob</b></a>.
</p><p>
The related commands
<a href="../commands/measure.html#area"><b>measure area</b></a> and
<a href="../commands/measure.html#volume"><b>measure volume</b></a>
report the <i>total</i> surface area and enclosed volume, respectively,
of a surface model (possibly comprising multiple blobs),
as does <a href="measurevolume.html"><b>Measure Volume and Area</b></a>.
To measure the 
<a href="../commands/surface.html#surfdefs">solvent-accessible surface area</a>
of an atomic structure, the command
<a href="../commands/measure.html#sasa"><b>measure sasa</b></a>
should be used instead. See also: 
<a href="volumeviewer.html"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>,
<a href="segment.html"><b>Segment Map</b></a>,
<a href="../commands/measure.html#buriedarea"><b>measure buriedarea</b></a>,
<a href="../commands/marker.html#connected"><b>marker connected</b></a>,
<a href="../measurements.html">measurements</a>
</p><p>
<b>Measure and Color Blobs</b> can be started 
from the <b>Volume Data</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu
or by clicking the <b>pick blobs</b>
<a href="mousemodes.html" title="Mouse Modes for Right Button...">
<img class="icon" border=1 src="mouse-icons/pickblobs.png"></a> icon
in the <a href="mousemodes.html"><b>Right Mouse</b></a> toolbar.
The tool window can be
<a href="../window.html#panels">moved, resized, <i>etc.</i></a>
</p><p>
Clicking a blob using the button assigned to the <b>pick blobs</b>
<a href="../commands/ui.html#mousemode">mouse mode</a>
reports the following in the tool window and in the
<a href="log.html"><b>Log</b></a>:
<ul>
<li><b>volume</b> enclosed in the blob
<li><b>area</b> of its triangulated surface
<li><b>size</b> in dimensions from longest to shortest
of the bounding box aligned with principal axes,
described <a href="#axesbox">below</a>
</ul>
<p>
Values reflect the physical units of the data, usually
&Aring;<sup>3</sup> for volume, &Aring;<sup>2</sup> for area,
&Aring; for length.
</p><p>
Options:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Color blob</b>
- color to use for the next picked blob
<li><b>Change color automatically</b>
- whether to set a new color randomly each time a blob is picked
<li><a name="axesbox"><b>Show principal axes box</b></a>
- whether to show a bounding box in the specified color
(default <table border cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle"><tr>
<td bgcolor=lime width="10px" title="lime"></td>
</tr></table>)
for each subsequently picked blob. A blob's bounding box is aligned with
its principal axes of inertia, calculated assuming a constant mass
per unit surface area. Box outlines are placed in a surface model
named <b>blob outline box</b>. Clicking <b>Erase boxes</b> closes any box models.
Even if the box is not shown, its size will be reported.
</ul>
<p>
The surface area and enclosed volume are computed from surface triangles.
Anything that alters the positions of vertices, such as changing the 
surface <a href="volumeviewer.html#threshold">threshold level</a>
in <a href="volumeviewer.html"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>,
will change the enclosed volume and surface area,
and lose any colors previously applied with <b>Measure and Color Blobs</b>.
</p><p>
Blob surface area and volume are not affected by
<a href="../commands/clip.html">clipping</a> (the
clipped-away parts will still be included), but the 
<a href="../commands/surface.html#cap">surface cap</a> 
where the clipping plane intersects the blob can itself be measured. 
In that case, the volume will be near-zero,
and the <b>boundary</b> (circumference) will also be reported.
</p><p>
Circumferences of any holes in the blob surface are also reported.
The volume enclosed by a surface with holes is calculated by assuming
each hole has a planar cap. These caps are not displayed or included in
the surface area determination. The number of holes is reported, as
planar caps may not represent missing data very well.
Holes in an isosurface may occur at the boundary of the data,
but by default these will already be covered with
<a href="../commands/volume.html#capfaces">planar caps</a>.
Such boundary caps will be included in
the surface area of the overall blob and will not be reported as holes.
