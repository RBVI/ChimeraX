<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: File History</h3>
<p>
The <b>File History</b> lists previously opened files 
as images and names that can be clicked to reopen the data.
This interface can be started as a separate tool from the <b>Tools</b> menu
(<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>) and/or
shown in the main window as part of <b>Rapid Access</b>
<img class="iconbar" src="ui-icons/lightning_night.png">
<img class="iconbar" src="ui-icons/lightning_day.png">.

<a href="../commands/open.html"><b>open</b></a>
</p><p>
The <b>File History</b> shows thumbnail images
and the filenames or identifiers of previously opened data. 
Clicking an image or name reopens the data, if it still exists, 
using the same options as used previously.
Simply pausing the cursor over an image or filename without clicking
shows the data's full pathname or database information.
The tool's <a href="../window.html#context-menu">context menu</a>
allows removing references to files that no longer exist.
</p><p>
The history is stored in a file in a platform-dependent standard location
and carries over between different ChimeraX sessions.
The location can be reported with command:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b><a href="../commands/info.html#path">info path</a> user unversioned data</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Images are saved right after data files are opened.
Each image shows the corresponding data in the absence of other models.
