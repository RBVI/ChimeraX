<b>Altloc Explorer</b> lists and manages <b><i>alternate locations</i></b>,
where an atomic structure contains multiple different positions for the
same set of atoms. In PDB format, for example, alternate locations are
indicated by a character identifier in column 17 of ATOM and HETATM records.
<!-- examples 1hf4, 1crc, 1a0m, 5nn8, 4ez4, 7qll, 6zx4 has many -->
</p><p>
For a given atom,
<b><i>ChimeraX uses only one of the alternate locations at a time</b></i>
for display and for any calculations. 
For each contiguous (through-bond) set of atoms
with alternate locations, the location used initially is that with
the highest average atomic occupancy, then as a tie-breaker, the lowest
average atomic B-factor, and if a  tie-breaker is still needed,
by alphabetical order of the alternate location ID.
</p><p>
To view multiple alternate locations simultaneously, however, see
the <a href="../commands/altlocs.html#show"><b>altlocs show</b></a> command.

The <b>Altloc Explorer</b> can be started 
from the <b>Structure Analysis</b> section of the 
<b>Tools</b> menu and manipulated like other panels
(<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
It is also implemented as the command
<a href="../commands/altlocs.html"><b>altlocs</b></a>.
</p><p>
The pulldown menu near the top of the dialog lists the current atomic models.
Choosing a specific model lists any residues with alternate locations
that it contains. Clicking the identifier of a residue with alternate
locations focuses on that residue and displays its atoms, and the adjacent
buttons can be used to change which ID (which location) is being used.
The <b>Set all to</b> checkboxes allow changing all of the
individual residue settings to a specific ID (if available) with a single click.

H-bonds are displayed as
<a href="../pseudobonds.html">pseudobonds</a> unless
<b>Show H-bonds</b> is turned off (initial default <b>on</b>).
Clicking <b>H-bond parameters</b> opens a separate dialog with
several of the calculation options that also appear in the
<a href="hbonds.html"><b>H-Bonds</b></a> tool;
clicking <b>Apply</b> recalculates the H-bonds accordingly.
