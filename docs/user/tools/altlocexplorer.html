<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Altloc Explorer</h3>
<p>
<b>Altloc Explorer</b> lists and manages <b><i>alternate locations</i></b>,
where an atomic structure contains multiple different positions for the
same set of atoms. In PDB format, for example, alternate locations are
indicated by a character identifier in column 17 of ATOM and HETATM records.
<!-- examples 1hf4, 1crc, 1a0m, 5nn8 -->
</p><p>
ChimeraX uses only one of the alternate locations at a time for display
and for any calculations. For each contiguous (through-bond) set of atoms
with alternate locations, the location used initially is that with
the highest average atomic occupancy, then as a tie-breaker, the lowest
average atomic B-factor, and if a  tie-breaker is still needed,
by alphabetical order of the alternate location ID.
</p><p>
The <b>Altloc Explorer</b> can be started 
from the <b>Structure Analysis</b> section of the 
<b>Tools</b> menu and manipulated like other panels
(<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
It is also implemented as the command
<a href="../commands/altlocs.html"><b>altlocs</b></a>.

The pulldown menu near the top of the dialog lists the current atomic models.
Choosing a specific model lists any residues with alternate locations
that it contains. Clicking the identifier of a residue with alternate
locations focuses on that residue and displays its atoms, and the adjacent
buttons can be used to change which ID (which location) is being used.
