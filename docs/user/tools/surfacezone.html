<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Surface Zone</h3>
<p>
<b>Surface Zone</b> limits the display of a 
<a href="volumeviewer.html">volume data</a> (map) surface 
to a zone around specified atoms or <a href="../markers.html">markers</a>.
It is also implemented as the command
<a href="../commands/surface.html#zone"><b>surface zone</b></a>
(with more options than shown in this tool).

<a href="../commands/volume.html#zone"><b>volume zone</b></a>
</p><p>
<b>Surface Zone</b> can be started 
from the <b>Volume Data</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu.
The tool window can be
<a href="../window.html#panels">moved, resized, <i>etc.</i></a>
</p><p>
The surface to zone should be chosen from the list of available map models,
and the atoms to use specified as <b>selected atoms</b> (the current
<a href="../selection.html">selection</a>) or chosen from the list of 
available atomic models. All atoms of a chosen model will be used, including
ligand, solvent, <i>etc.</i>, even if they are not displayed. To use
only the biopolymer portion of a model, either the remaining atoms should
be deleted, or only those atoms <a href="../selection.html">selected</a>
and designated as <b>selected atoms</b> instead.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Zone</b> limits the display of the chosen surface
to areas within a specified distance (<b>Radius</b>) of any of the atoms.
Surfaces are composed of triangles; only triangles with all three
vertices in the zone will be shown.
</p><p>
The <b>Radius</b> can be adjusted by moving the slider or by typing in 
a new value. The slider is logarithmic to cover a wide range of values.
There is no way to use different radii for different atoms.
If the set of atoms is changed or an atom is moved relative to the surface,
<b>Zone</b> must be clicked again to update the zone.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>No Zone</b> stops limiting surface display to the zone.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Help</b> shows this page
in the <a href="helpviewer.html"><b>Help Viewer</b></a>.
