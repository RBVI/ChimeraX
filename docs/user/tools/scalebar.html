<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Scale Bar</h3>
<p>
<b>Scale Bar</b> draws a horizontal bar to show the length scale of objects
in the graphics window.
A text label is not included, but can be added with the
<a href="../commands/2dlabels.html"><b>2dlabels</b></a> command.
See also:
<a href="colorkey.html"><b>Color Key</b></a>,
<a href="../images.html">making images</a>
</p><p>
The <b>Scale Bar</b> dialog can be opened from the <b>Depiction</b> 
section of the <b>Tools</b> menu and manipulated like other panels 
(<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
It is also implemented as the command 
<a href="../commands/scalebar.html"><b>scalebar</b></a>.
</p><p>
All settings can be edited interactively:
</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><b>Show scalebar</b> &ndash; whether to display the scale bar
<li><b>Length</b> 
&ndash; scale bar length in physical units of distance 
(typically &Aring;) based on the pixel-to-length
correspondence at the center of rotation.
The length in pixels will automatically adjust for changes in zoom.
In perspective projection, objects appear progressively larger in the front
and smaller in the back; for a constant relationship of pixels to length
at all depths, use orthographic projection instead
(command <a href="../commands/camera.html"><b>camera ortho</b></a>).
<li><b>Color</b></a> &ndash; scale bar color
(click the square color well to use the system color editor)
<li><b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>
&ndash; position of the scale bar's lower-left corner expressed in fractional 
coordinates 0.0-1.0, where 1.0 represents the full width (X) or height (Y) 
of the <a href="../window.html">graphics window</a>
and 1.0,1.0 its top right corner.
Alternatively, the scale bar can be repositioned by dragging
with the <b>move label</b>
<span class="nowrap"><a href="../commands/ui.html#mousemode">mouse mode</a>
<a href="mousemodes.html" title="Mouse Modes for Right Button...">
<img class="icon" border=1 src="mouse-icons/movelabel.png"></a></span>.
<li><b>Thickness (pixels)</b> 
&ndash; scale bar height in pixels
</ul>
<p>
The scale bar is a 2D object (no depth, cannot be moved forward/backward)
and is simply drawn on top of the view, like
<a href="../commands/2dlabels.html">2D labels</a>.
It is created as a 2D labels submodel that can be controlled with 
the <a href="modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a> and
general commands such as <a href="../commands/close.html"><b>close</b></a> and
<a href="../commands/show.html"><b>show/hide</b></a>.
