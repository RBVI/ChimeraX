<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Find Cavities</h3>
<p>
<b>Find Cavities</b> detects cavities or pockets in an atomic structure using 
<b><i>KVFinder</i></b>, a method based on surface shape, as described in:
<blockquote>

<p>
<b>Find Cavities</b> installs and runs 
<a href="https://lbc-lnbio.github.io/pyKVFinder/"
target="_blank"><i>pyKVFinder</i></a> locally. It is also implemented as the
<a href="../commands/kvfinder.html"><b>kvfinder</b></a> command.
The authors of KVFinder (at the Brazilian Biosciences National Lab) also provide
a <a href="https://kvfinder-web.cnpem.br/" target="_blank">web service</a>,
but it is not used in the ChimeraX implementation.

<b>Find Cavities</b> can be started from the 
<b>Binding Analysis</b> or <b>Structure Analysis</b>
section of the <b>Tools</b> menu.
One or more atomic models should be chosen from the list that appears.
Clicking <b>OK</b> runs the calculation, and tabulates the results for 
each atomic model in a separate <a href="#cavitylist">cavity list</a> window.
These results are also reported in the <a href="log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
Default parameters are used;
for details on the method and/or to use nondefault values, see the
<a href="../commands/kvfinder.html"><b>kvfinder</b></a> command.
</p><p>
In the graphics window, the cavities are shown as clouds of points 
on a grid. These collections of dots are opened as (pseudo)atomic models
in ChimeraX, each cavity as a separate submodel assigned a unique color.

</p>
<h3>Cavity List</h3>
<p>
Running <b>Find Cavities</b> (or the
<a href="../commands/kvfinder.html"><b>kvfinder</b></a> command
with <b>showTool true</b>) on an atomic model opens a separate window 
listing the cavities that were found in the model, with sortable columns:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ID</b> &ndash; cavity model number (these models are also listed
in the <a href="modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>)
<li>a color well; click to change the color interactively
<li><b>Volume</b> &ndash; cavity volume as determined by <b><i>KVFinder</i></b>
<li><b>Surface Area</b> &ndash; cavity surface area
as determined by <b><i>KVFinder</i></b>
<li><b>Points</b> &ndash; number of grid points in the cavity,
displayed as (pseudo)atoms in ChimeraX
</ul>
<p>
If a cavity list is closed but the corresponding cavity models still exist,
the list can be reshown by choosing it from the bottom section of the 
<b>Tools</b> menu.
</p><p>
<a name="chosen"></a>
One or more cavities can be <b><i>chosen</i></b> from the list
by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button;
<b>Ctrl</b>-click (or <b>command</b>-click if using a Mac)
toggles whether a row is chosen.
Chosen rows are highlighted in the dialog, and the following options
(if turned on) are applied to the corresponding cavity models:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Focus view on cavity</b>
<li><b>Select nearby atoms</b> &dash; <a href="../selection.html">select</a>
atoms within the specified <a href="#nearby">nearby distance</a>
of any cavity point
<li><b>Show nearby residues</b> &dash; show all atoms of residues with 
any nearby atoms. Other atoms are not hidden, however.
<li><b>Surface nearby atoms</b> &dash; show the molecular surface of nearby 
atoms. The surface area calculated by <b><i>KVFinder</i></b> for the cavity
is <i>not</i> based on this patch of molecular surface.
  <ul>
  <li><b>Color surface by lipophilicity</b> &dash; color the molecular surface
by <a href="../commands/mlp.html">molecular lipophilicity potential</a> (MLP)
using <table border cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle"><tr>
<td bgcolor=darkcyan width="10px" title="darkcyan"></td>
<td bgcolor=white width="10px" title="white"></td>
<td bgcolor=darkgoldenrod width="10px" title="darkgoldenrod"></td>
</tr></table> over the range -20 (hydrophilic) to 20 (hydrophobic).
Note that once this coloring has been applied to a given molecular surface, 
it persists even if this option is turned off. The surface would need to be 
removed and recreated or manually recolored to get rid of the coloring by MLP.
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="nearby"></a>
<b>"Nearby" atoms/residues are within</b> [<i>distance</i>] <b>angstroms
of cavity points</b>
&ndash; <i>distance</i> criterion for the checkbox options above
