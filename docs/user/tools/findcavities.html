<b>Find Cavities</b> installs and runs

the <a href="https://pypi.org" target="_blank">PyPi server</a>).
It is also implemented as the
<a href="../commands/kvfinder.html"><b>kvfinder</b></a> command.
The authors of KVFinder (at the Brazilian Biosciences National Lab) also provide
a <a href="https://kvfinder-web.cnpem.br/" target="_blank">web service</a>,
but it is not used in the ChimeraX implementation.

Conceptually, the method rolls two spherical probes
over the VDW spheres of the macromolecule to identify cavities. 
PDB HET residues (solvent, ligands, and ions) are ignored.
The smaller &ldquo;inner&rdquo; probe defines the
molecular surface, and the larger &ldquo;outer&rdquo; probe
gives an initial estimate of the outer limits of the cavities. 
Points on a grid are evaluated as to whether they fall within the
boundaries set by the probes. Next, the cavities are trimmed further 
from the exterior to avoid finding too many shallow indentations. 
Finally, cavities smaller than a specified volume are omitted.
</p><p>
<b>Find Cavities</b> can be started from the 
<b>Binding Analysis</b> or <b>Structure Analysis</b>
section of the <b>Tools</b> menu.
One or more atomic models should be chosen from the resulting list.
<b>Cavity detection settings</b> and associated buttons:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Grid spacing</b>
(initial default <b>0.60</b> &Aring;)
&ndash; a smaller spacing gives a higher-resolution result, 
but can significantly increase the calculation time
<li><b>Inner probe radius</b>
(initial default <b>1.4</b> &Aring;)
<li><b>Outer probe radius</b>
(initial default <b>4.0</b> &Aring;)
&ndash; a larger outer probe increases calculation time
<li><b>Exterior trim distance</b>
(initial default <b>2.4</b> &Aring;)
<li><b>Minimum cavity volume</b>
(initial default <b>5.0</b> &Aring;<sup>3</sup>)
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Save</b> saves the current parameter values as user 
<a href="../preferences.html#other">preferences</a>
<li><b>Reset</b> resets the dialog to the initial defaults
without changing any preferences
<li><b>Restore</b> populates the dialog with the last saved preferences
</ul>
<p>
Clicking <b>Apply</b> (or <b>OK</b>, which also dismisses the dialog)
runs the calculation. The first time the tool is used,
it may take a little longer to run as
<a href="https://lbc-lnbio.github.io/pyKVFinder/"
target="_blank"><i>pyKVFinder</i></a> is installed locally.
</p><p>
The results for each atomic model are tabulated
in a separate <a href="#cavitylist">cavity list</a> window
and reported in the <a href="log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
In the graphics window, the cavities are shown as clouds of points 
on a grid. These collections of dots are opened as (pseudo)atomic models
in ChimeraX, each cavity as a separate submodel assigned a unique color.
</p><p>
<b>Replace existing results, if any</b> (default <b>on</b>) 
indicates whether to overwrite the cavity dots and
<a href="#cavitylist">cavity list</a> when the calculation is
re-run on the same atomic model. Otherwise, a new
<a href="#cavitylist">cavity list</a> and additional
cavity models will be created without closing the existing ones.
<p><p>

see the <a href="../commands/kvfinder.html"><b>kvfinder</b></a> command.

<h3>Cavity List</h3>
<p>
Running <b>Find Cavities</b> (or the
<a href="../commands/kvfinder.html"><b>kvfinder</b></a> command
with <b>showTool true</b>) on an atomic model opens a separate window 
listing the cavities that were found in the model, with sortable columns:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ID</b> &ndash; cavity model number (these models are also listed
in the <a href="modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>)
<li>a color well; click to change the color interactively
<li><b>Volume</b> &ndash; cavity volume as determined by <b><i>KVFinder</i></b>
<li><b>Surface Area</b> &ndash; cavity surface area
as determined by <b><i>KVFinder</i></b>
<li><b>Points</b> &ndash; number of grid points in the cavity,
displayed as (pseudo)atoms in ChimeraX
<li><b>Average Depth</b> 
&ndash; average depth of pocket points, 
<a name="depth"></a>
where the <b><i>depth</i></b> of a point is its approximate distance
in &Aring; from the pocket opening. 
Points in completely enclosed pockets are assigned a zero depth.
<li><b>Maximum Depth</b> 
&ndash; how far from the opening the pocket extends
</ul>
<p>
If a cavity list is closed but the corresponding cavity models still exist,
the list can be reshown by choosing it from the bottom section of the 
<b>Tools</b> menu.
</p><p>
<a name="chosen"></a>
One or more cavities can be <b><i>chosen</i></b> from the list
by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button;
<b>Ctrl</b>-click (or <b>command</b>-click if using a Mac)
toggles whether a row is chosen.
Chosen rows are highlighted in the dialog, and the following options
(if turned on) are applied to the corresponding cavity models:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Focus view on cavity</b>
<li><b>Show cavity surface</b>
<li><b>Select cavity points</b> &ndash; <a href="../selection.html">select</a>
the grid points (pseudoatoms) defining the cavity
<li><b>Select nearby atoms</b> &ndash; <a href="../selection.html">select</a>
atoms within the specified <a href="#nearby">nearby distance</a>
of any cavity point
<!-- may be shown if from previously saved session
<li><b>Show nearby residues</b> &ndash; show all atoms of residues with 
any nearby atoms; although other atoms (not nearby) are not hidden, 
unchecking the option will hide the nearby residues of the currently 
chosen cavities
-->
<li><b>Show contacting residues</b> &ndash; show atoms of the cavity-contacting
residues determined by <b><i>KVFinder</i></b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Include backbone contacts</b> 
&ndash; whether to include residues with backbone-only contacts in the above
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="nearby"></a>
<b>"Nearby" atoms are within</b> [<i>distance</i>] <b>angstroms

&ndash; distance criterion for the <b>nearby</b> checkbox options above
</p><p>
<b>Color open cavities by depth from outside</b> 
&ndash; color cavity points by <a href="#depth">depth</a>
(assigned as atom <a href="../attributes.html">attribute</a>
<b>kvfinder_depth</b>) using

<h3>Coloring Cavity Surfaces by Protein Properties</h3>
<p>
The <b>Find Cavities</b> tool includes the option to show surfaces around
the clouds of grid points.
It might be interesting to color these surfaces by properties 
from the surrounding protein. However, since only the cavity points 
(and not the protein atoms) were used to calculate the surfaces,
the coloring command must specify using the protein atoms to calculate 
the properties for coloring these surfaces.
</p><p>
For example, if the option to show cavity surfaces is turned on, 
at least one cavity surface has been shown, and
the protein structure is model #1 and the computed cavity models are 
#1.2.1, #1.2.2, (<i>etc.</i>), the following commands could be 
used to color the surfaces by 
Coulombic electrostatic potential (ESP) and
and molecular lipophilic potential (MLP), respectively:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b><a href="../commands/coulombic.html">coulombic</a>
(#1 & protein) surfaces #1.2 offset -1</b>
<br><br>
<b><a href="../commands/mlp.html">mlp</a> (#1 & protein) surfaces #1.2</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
A negative offset is used to show the ESP
<b><i>inside</i></b> the cavity surfaces, where binding might occur.
For the usual case of coloring a protein surface by its own potential,
a positive offset (default <b>1.4</b> &Aring;) is used to show the potential
<b><i>outside</i></b> the surface, where interactions with other molecules 
would occur.
</p><p>
These types of coloring can be combined with surface transparency, for example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b><a href="../commands/transparency.html">transparency</a> #1.2 30</b>
