<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Meeting</h3>

<p>
<b>Meeting</b> allows sharing a scene between
two or more ChimeraX instances running on different computers.
Its main purpose is to allow multi-person
<a href="../vr.html">virtual reality</a> (VR) sessions in ChimeraX.
It can also be used without VR, but in that case,
a desktop screen-sharing program may be a more reliable alternative.
Each participant is represented by a head-position image and 
hand-controller pointer cones
so that participants can see each other pointing at objects in the scene.
For non-VR participants, the camera view is synchronized, and
the cone indicating the mouse pointer position of a non-VR user
is displayed to others when the user pauses the mouse over a model,
as for picking.
</p><p>
The <b>Meeting</b> tool allows changing some of the major 
settings for ChimeraX meetings, a subset of those available via the
<a href="../commands/meeting.html"><b>meeting</b></a> command.
</p>

<a name="dialog"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: Meeting</a>]
</p>
<h3>Dialog Settings and Buttons</h3>
<p>
The <b>Meeting</b> dialog can be opened
from the <b>General</b> section of the 
<b>Tools</b> menu and manipulated like other panels 
(<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
Settings other than meeting name are remembered as
<a href="../preferences.html#other">preferences</a>. 
The current settings can be reported with the
<a href="../commands/meeting.html#settings"><b>meeting settings</b></a> command.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Meeting name</b>
&ndash; a text identifier for the meeting, assigned by the person
who creates the meeting and used by other participants to join the meeting. 
Meeting names are not case-sensitive.
<li><b>Participant name</b>
&ndash; a text identifier for the individual within the meeting environment
<li><b>Pointer color</b>
&ndash; a color for the particant's hand-controller pointer cones in VR, 
or mouse cursor position if not in VR
(initial default <b>lime</b>
<table border cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle"><tr>
<td bgcolor=lime width="10px" title="lime"></td></tr></table>)
<li><b>Photo</b>
&ndash; an image to represent the participant's headset position in VR
</ul>
<p>Buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Create</b>
&ndash; start a ChimeraX meeting with the specified meeting name
<li><b>Join</b>
&ndash; join an existing ChimeraX meeting with the specified meeting name
<li><b>Leave</b>
&ndash; exit the meeting
<li><b>Options...</b>
&ndash; show additional meeting starting and joining options.
  <ul>
  <li><b>Start meeting using server</b>.
    Initial default <b>chimeraxmeeting.net</b>
    is a publicly available computer that forwards connections
    to the computer that started the meeting (needed when the latter cannot
    be reached by participants because it is behind a firewall).
    Server <b>direct</b> connects directly to the computer that started the meeting.
    To add a new private meeting server to this menu, see the
    <a href="../commands/meeting.html#server"><b>meeting server</b></a> command. 
    See also the <a href="../commands/meeting.html#setupserver">instructions</a>
    for setting up a new meeting server.
  <li><b>Join meeting using ssh</b>.
    When joining a meeting ssh can be used to help get through an outgoing firewall
    around the joiner's computer that limits outgoing connections on unknown ports with
    unknown protocols, or firewalls around the server that limit incoming connections.
    To use ssh with a server other than <b>chimeraxmeeting.net</b> requires that the joiner
    have the ssh key for the server defined with the
    <a href="../commands/meeting.html#server">meeting server</a> command.
    Default is not to use ssh.
  </ul>
<li><b>Help</b>
&ndash; show documentation in the 
<a href="helpviewer.html"><b>Help Viewer</b></a>
