<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: ViewDockX</h3>
<p>
<b>ViewDockX</b> is a tool for the interactive analysis of
molecular docking results.
Users can click through a list of docked compounds (or different
poses of the same compound) to view them individually in the context
of a binding site. Results can be sorted, rated, and saved,
and scores or other numerical descriptors can be plotted.
See also: 
<a href="../commands/hbonds.html"><b>hbonds</b></a>,
<a href="../commands/clashes.html"><b>clashes</b></a>,
an <a href="../formats/dock4.mol2">example file</a> of compounds docked to 
H-ras (the protein part of PDB entry
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=121p"
target="_blank">121p</a>)
</p><p>
Currently supported formats are Mol2 files from
<a href="http://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/"
target="_blank">UCSF&nbsp;DOCK</a>&nbsp;v4-6 and
<a href="https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-discovery/components/gold/"
target="_blank">GOLD</a>.
</p><p>
After one or more files of
<a href="../commands/open.html#atomic">docking results</a> have been
opened, a table listing the different compounds or poses
can be shown by choosing <b>ViewDockX</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu
or by using the command:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>viewdockx</b>
<br>&ndash; or &ndash;<br>
<b>viewdockx 
&nbsp;<a href="../commands/atomspec.html#hierarchy"><i>docked-compound-models</i></a></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
...the latter to limit the table to only a subset of the docked compound
models currently open.
The <a href="#table"><b>ViewDockX</b> table</a> and associated 
<a href="#plots">plots</a> can be manipulated
like other panels in ChimeraX (<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
</p>

<a name="table"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: ViewDockX</a>]
</p>
<h3>ViewDockX Table</h3>
<p>
In the table of docking results, the rows are different compounds or
different positions of a compound, and the columns show additional data
read from the input, typically including compound names
and docking scores. The first two columns are generated automatically:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>RATING</b> - star rating (click to change)
<li><b>ID</b> - model identification number
</ul>
<p>
Any additional columns that appear when <b>ViewDockX</b> is first started
reflect information read from the input file(s).
</p><p>
<a name="choosing"></a>
One or more docked compounds can be shown in the graphics window
(and the rest in the table hidden) by
<b><i>choosing</i></b> their rows in the table with the mouse.
Chosen rows are highlighted in yellow.
A contiguous block of rows can be chosen with click-drag, and
<!--
or by clicking on the first (or last) and then Shift-clicking
on the last (or first) in the desired block.
-->
Ctrl-click (Cmd-click on Mac) toggles a row between chosen and not chosen.
When multiple compounds are chosen, changing the star rating of one
also changes it for the others, in parallel.
</p><p>
Specific columns can be hidden/shown by clicking the bar across the top 
of the table (&ldquo;N columns displayed...&rdquo;)
and using the resulting checkbox menu.
Clicking the header of a column sorts by the values in that column,
and a multi-column sort can be performed by clicking one header
and Shift-clicking one or more additional headers.
Column widths can be adjusted by dragging the vertical dividing lines.
</p><p>
Buttons above the table:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Show All Structures</b>
- <a href="#choosing">choose</a>/show all compounds in the table
<li><b>Graph</b>
- <a href="#plots">plot</a> all compounds along the X-axis
vs. one or more numerical descriptors (table columns) on the Y-axis
<li><b>Plot</b>
- <a href="#plots">plot</a> different numerical descriptors vs. each other
for all compounds
<li><b>Add HBonds</b> 
- calculate and add a column for
the number of H-bonds between each compound and all other atoms
(excluding the other docked compounds), using the
<a href="../commands/hbonds.html"><b>hbonds</b></a> command
<!-- hbonds [dock-models] restrict cross reveal true -->
<li><b>Add Clashes</b> 
- calculate and add a column for
the number of clashes between each compound and all other atoms
(excluding the other docked compounds), using the
<a href="../commands/clashes.html"><b>clashes</b></a> command
<!-- clashes [dock-models] test others reveal true -->
<li><b>Save...</b> save all compound structures and descriptors 
(including current star ratings) to a Mol2 file; the file can be
reopened later for further analysis with <b>ViewDockX</b>
<li><b>Close</b> - close any structures with star ratings no greater 
than the specified number of stars, and remove their rows from the table
</ul>
<p>
<b>ViewDockX</b> table status is saved in 
<a href="../commands/save.html#session">sessions</a>, including
which columns are shown and which rows are <a href="#choosing">chosen</a>,
but not window size or location.

</p>
<h3>Graphs and Plots</h3>
<p>
Multiple graph/plot windows can be shown for the same set of docking results.
</p><p>
Clicking the <b>Graph</b> button near the top left of the
<a href="#table"><b>ViewDockX</b> table</a> allows plotting all compounds 
along the X-axis versus one or more numerical descriptors on the Y-axis.
One of the numerical descriptors can be chosen for the <b>Sort</b> order,
and all or a subset of them as values to <b>Graph</b>.
The data can also be shown as a histogram with specified number of bins.
</p><p>
Clicking the <b>Plot</b> button near the top left of the
<a href="#table"><b>ViewDockX</b> table</a> opens another window for
plotting numerical descriptors versus each other. 
Up to two plots can be shown in the same window, 
with numerical descriptors chosen for the X and Y axes of each.
</p><p>
A &ldquo;halo&rdquo; around a plotted point indicates 
that the compound is currently shown in the graphics window.
Pausing the cursor over a plotted point shows the compound's descriptor values.
Clicking a plotted point or histogram bar shows the corresponding compound(s)
in the graphics window and hides the others.
