<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Modeller Comparative</h3>
<p>
The <b>Modeller Comparative</b> modeling tool is an interface to the
<a href="https://www.salilab.org/modeller/" target="_blank">Modeller</a>
program running on a web service hosted by the
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Overview/index.html" target="_blank">UCSF
RBVI</a>. The command-line implementation is
<a href="../commands/modeller.html#comparative"><b>modeller comparative</b></a>.

Comparative modeling (sometimes called &ldquo;homology modeling&rdquo;)
generates theoretical models of a protein using one or more known related 
structures and a sequence alignment of the known and unknown structures. 
The protein chain to be modeled is the <b><i>target</i></b>, and a 
known atomic structure used for modeling is a <b><i>template</i></b>. 
</p><p>
Modeller is developed by the 
<a href="https://www.salilab.org" target="_blank">&Scaron;ali Lab</a>,
and its users should cite:
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Modeller comparative modeling requires the following for each target chain:
</p>
<ol>
<li>At least one template structure.
<!-- apparently they do not need to be superimposed -->
<br><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Modeling a multimer requires a multimeric template structure
with the same stoichiometry and expected spatial relationship.
Modeller uses this stoichiometry and spatial relationship rather
than trying to calculate it.
  </ul>
<br>
<li>A sequence alignment that includes the sequence of the target;
other sequences may also be included. 
The sequence alignment and template structure(s) should be open in ChimeraX
and the template(s) <a href="sequenceviewer.html#association">associated</a>
with sequence(s) in the alignment.
<br><br>
  <ul>
<!--
<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="10px"><tr>
<td class="shaded">
-->
  <li>The target sequence can be 
<a href="../commands/open.html#fetch">fetched</a>
from <a href="https://www.uniprot.org" target="_blank">UniProt</a> or
opened from a <a href="../commands/open.html#sequence">file</a>.
That single sequence suffices as the 
&ldquo;alignment&rdquo; if the template is similar enough in
sequence to <a href="sequenceviewer.html#association">associate</a> with it
(see an
<a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/features.html#multichain-modeller"
target="_blank">example</a>).
Alternatively, a multiple sequence alignment of the target and template(s)
can be opened from a <a href="../commands/open.html#sequence">file</a>,
if available, or obtained by using the
<a href="../commands/blastprotein.html"><b>blastprotein</b></a>
command to search for templates with the target sequence as a query.
<!--
</td></tr></table>
</blockquote>
-->
<br><br>
  <li>Modeling a heteromultimer requires a separate sequence alignment
for each unique chain. For example, modeling  an
&alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub> tetramer requires a
template structure that is also a &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>
tetramer with its two &alpha; subunits
<a href="sequenceviewer.html#association">associated</a>
with one alignment containing the target &alpha; sequence,
and its two &beta; subunits 
<a href="sequenceviewer.html#association">associated</a>
with another alignment containing the target &beta; sequence.

</p>
<h3>Startup and Input</h3>
<p>
The <b>Modeller Comparative</b> tool
can be opened from the <b>Sequence</b> section of the
<b>Tools</b> menu and manipulated like other panels
(<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
It is also implemented as the 
<a href="../commands/modeller.html#comparative"><b>modeller comparative</b></a>
command.
</p><p>
One sequence alignment per target should be chosen (highlighted) 
in the top section of the dialog. Immediately below, for each chosen alignment,
the name of the target sequence should be selected from the pull-down menu.
</p><p>
<b>Basic</b> settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Make multichain model from multichain template</b> 
(initial default <b>on</b>)
&ndash; whether to retain template homomultimeric states;
for example, if the template structure is a homotrimer, whether to model 
the target as a homotrimer instead of as a monomer with three templates
<!-- if multiple templates, will give the highest multimer, e.g. dimer if
one template is dimer and the other is monomer -->
<li><b>Modeller license key</b>
&ndash; see <a href="#key">above</a>
<li><b>Number of models</b> (initial default <b>5</b>, maximum 1000)
&ndash; number of models to create
</ul>
<p>
<b>Advanced</b> settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Build models with hydrogens</b>
(initial default <b>off</b>) 
&ndash; whether to include hydrogen atoms in the output models; warning: slow
<li><b>Include non-water HETATM residues from template</b>
(initial default <b>off</b>)
&ndash; whether to include HETATM residues other than water (ligands, ions,
detergent, <i>etc.</i>) from templates in the output models.
Any such residues not desired in the output should be
<a href="../commands/delete.html">deleted</a> from the template(s) beforehand
if the option is turned on.
<li><b>Include water molecules from template</b>
(initial default <b>off</b>)
&ndash; whether to include water residues from templates in the output models.
Any water residues not desired in the output should be
<a href="../commands/delete.html">deleted</a> from the template(s) beforehand
if the option is turned on.
<li><b>Temporary folder location (optional)</b>
&ndash; use the specified location for temporary files; 
otherwise, a location will be generated automatically
<li><b>Use fast/approximate mode (produces only one model)</b>
(initial default <b>off</b>)
&ndash; use fast/approximate mode (~3 times faster) to get a rough idea of
model appearance or to confirm that the alignment is reasonable.
This mode does not randomize the starting structure (generates only a
single model) and performs very little optimization of the target function.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Modeller Comparative</b> settings including the 
<a href="#key">license key</a> are automatically saved in the
<a href="../preferences.html">preferences</a>.
Other than the license key, the remembered settings apply only to the GUI;
the command defaults are not changed.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Cancel</b> simply dismisses the dialog, whereas <b>OK</b>
sends information to the web service and initiates the calculation.

</p>
<h3>Modeller Results</h3>
<p>
When results are returned, the new models are opened, listed in the 
<a href="modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a> along with any other
models present in ChimeraX,
and automatically superimposed on the lowest-model-ID template structure with
<a href="../commands/matchmaker.html"><b>matchmaker</b></a>.
Scores for the comparative models are shown in a <b>Modeller Results</b> panel:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Model</b> - model ID number
<li>
<a href="https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/display.cgi?type=help&server=modbase#model_score"
target="_blank"><b>GA341</b></a> -
model score derived from statistical potentials
(see
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11790853" target="_blank">Melo
<i>et al.</i></a>, <i>Protein Sci</i> <b>11</b>:430 (2002)),
automatically assigned as a model <a href="../attributes.html">attribute</a>
named <b>modeller_GA341</b>.
Higher values signify better models, with those &gt; 0.7 generally indicating a
<a href="https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/display.cgi?type=help&server=modbase#reliablemodel"
target="_blank">reliable model</a>,
defined as &ge; 95% probability of correct fold.
<li>
<a href="https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/display.cgi?type=help&server=modbase#dope"
target="_blank"><b>zDOPE</b></a>
&ndash; normalized Discrete Optimized Protein Energy (DOPE), an
atomic distance-dependent statistical score (see
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17075131" target="_blank">Shen
and Sali</a>, <i>Protein Sci</i> <b>15</b>:2507 (2006)),
automatically assigned as a model <a href="../attributes.html">attribute</a>
named <b>modeller_zDOPE</b>.
Lower values signify better models, with those &lt; 0 generally indicating a
<a href="https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/display.cgi?type=help&server=modbase#reliablemodel"
target="_blank">reliable model</a>.
</ul>
<p>
Clicking a row in the panel shows the corresponding comparative
model and hides the others. Clicking elsewhere in the panel shows all
of the comparative models at once. 
Clicking a column header sorts on the values in that column.
</p><p>
The panel's <a href="../window.html#context-menu">context menu</a>
includes an option to <b>Fetch Additional Scores</b> using the
<a href="https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/evaluation/"
target="_blank">SaliLab Model Evaluation Server</a>:
<ul>
<li>
<b>GA341</b> and <b>zDOPE</b> (described above), if missing for any models
<li>
<b>predicted NO35</b> &ndash;
<a href="https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/display.cgi?type=help&server=modbase#tsvmod"
target="_blank">TSVMod</a>-predicted native overlap (3.5 &Aring;),
the fraction of C&alpha; atoms in the model within 3.5 &Aring;
of the corresponding atoms in the native structure after rigid-body
superposition (see
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18832340" target="_blank">Eramian
<i>et al.</i></a>, <i>Protein Sci</i> <b>17</b>:1881 (2008));
automatically assigned as a model <a href="../attributes.html">attribute</a>
named <b>modeller_predicted_NO35</b>.
<li>
<b>predicted RMSD</b> &ndash;
<a href="https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/display.cgi?type=help&server=modbase#tsvmod"
target="_blank">TSVMod</a>-predicted C&alpha; root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)
of the model from the native structure (see
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18832340" target="_blank">Eramian
<i>et al.</i></a>, <i>Protein Sci</i> <b>17</b>:1881 (2008));
automatically assigned as a model <a href="../attributes.html">attribute</a>
named <b>modeller_predicted_RMSD</b>.
</ul>
<p>
The same <a href="#key">Modeller license key</a> as needed for 
comparative modeling is also required by the evaluation server, 
but it does not need to be specified again.
Fetching additional scores is also implemented as the command
<a href="../commands/modeller.html#scores"><b>modeller scores</b></a>.
</p><p>
After additional scores have been fetched, the
<a href="../window.html#context-menu">context menu</a> option
changes to <b>Refresh Scores</b> to allow re-evaluation after models have been 
modified (for example, to delete untemplated regions built as extended tails).
However, since re-evaluation does not use all of the same information
as does scoring during the original modeling process, it may worsen
pre-existing <b>GA341</b> and <b>zDOPE</b> scores and should only be used 
after making modifications that are expected to improve the scores.
