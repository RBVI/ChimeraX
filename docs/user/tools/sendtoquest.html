<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Send to Quest</h3>
<p>
This tool sends a scene to an Oculus Quest VR headset to be viewed by the 
LookSee application. See
<a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/data/looksee-mar2023/looksee.html"
target="_blank">ChimeraX VR on standalone Quest headsets</a>
for how to install LookSee on a Quest 2 or Quest Pro headset.
See also: <a href="../vr.html">ChimeraX virtual reality</a>
</p><p>
The scene must be simple enough for the Quest 2 or Quest Pro graphics to handle 
without flickering. If the room is shown (with pass-through video) the scene
should have &lt;700,000 triangles, and with room not shown 
(black background) &lt;900,000 triangles.
</p><p>
In the LookSee app, clicking the A or X hand-controller button
will show the user interface, and clicking &ldquo;Open new files&rdquo;
will make new files sent from ChimeraX automatically display.
There may be up to a 5-second delay displaying a new file.

<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>
To send the scene, the computer must know the Quest internet address.
Start LookSee and enable "Receive files from ChimeraX" and it will
show the address, for example, "Receive files from 192.168.0.157".
Enter that address in the ChimeraX Send to Quest tool under Options.
More detailed instructions are <a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/data/looksee-mar2023/looksee.html"
target="_blank">available</a>.
</p>

<h3>Using a USB cable instead of WiFi</h3>
<p>
We don't recommend this method for sending scenes to the Quest unless a wifi connection is not available.
To send a scene from ChimeraX using a USB cable connection,
the computer must have the adb (Android Debug Bridge) command-line program installed
(details <a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/data/looksee-mar2023/looksee.html" target="_blank">here</a>).
</p><p>
After setting up a USB connection it is possible to switch to sending wirelessly using adb.
To set up wireless transfer, follow these steps:
</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Plug in Quest to computer with usb cable.
  <li>Click Allow Access in Quest headset.
  <li>Select the "Use adb executable" option in under the Send to Quest Options.
  </ol>

<p>It is also possible to use adb with a wireless connection with these additional steps.</p>

  <ol start=4>
  <li>Check Quest IP address in headset clicking the wifi symbol in the Quest,
    then clicking the connected wifi name, then scroll down and click Advanced.
  <li>Use adb command "adb tcpip 5555" from a shell on the computer.
  <li>Use adb command "adb 192.168.0.135" to specify the Quest IP address.
  <li>Disconnect usb cable from Quest.
  <li>Optionally, check connected devices with "adb devices"
</ol>
