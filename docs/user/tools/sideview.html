The <b>Side View</b> tool provides an intuitive way to zoom
the view and to control the <b>near</b> and <b>far</b> clipping planes, 
which always remain perpendicular to the line of sight.
For rotatable (<b>front</b> and <b>back</b>) clipping planes, see the
<a href="../commands/clip.html"><b>clip</b></a> command.

The <b>Side View</b> can be opened from the <b>Tools</b> menu
or by clicking the <a href="graphics.html"><b>Graphics</b></a> icon
<img class="icon" src="toolbar-icons/sideview.png" alt="computer generated image">.
Like other tools, it can be
<a href="../window.html#panels">moved, resized, <i>etc.</i></a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The square on the left represents the viewer or <b>eye position</b>.
It can be dragged horizontally to adjust the zoom.
<br><br>
</li><li>The vertical lines represent the <b>near</b> and <b>far</b>
<a href="../commands/clip.html">clipping planes</a>.
Dragging either line activates (as needed) and moves the corresponding plane.
<br><br>
</li><li>The lines emanating from the eye position show the field of vision.
The lines diverge when perspective is used (default),
but are parallel to each other in the orthographic
<a href="../commands/camera.html">camera mode</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The <b>clip</b> checkboxes indicate whether the <b>near</b> and/or <b>far</b>
clipping planes are active.
</p><p>
If the interactive response becomes slow with very large structures 
or other copious or large data,
closing the <b>Side View</b> may help by reducing the rendering load.
</p><p>
Capping of clipped surfaces can be controlled
with a <a href="../preferences.html">preference</a> setting and/or the
<a href="../commands/surface.html#cap"><b>surface cap</b></a> command.
</p>
<!-- 
Details from Tom Goddard Nov 2025:
When you have not moved the front and back clipping planes, they are 
positioned in front and behind all the displayed models. The front and back 
clip planes are usually not at the very front-most and back-most atom.
Here is how they are computed. Each model has a rectangular bounding box 
which just touches the atom rendering at the x,y,z edges. All those 
displayed model boxes are combined into one box that contains them all.
The center of that box plus or minus one box radius (= radius of sphere 
containing the box) is where the front and back clip planes are positioned 
when the clip planes have not been manually moved. These rules for 
determining the front and back positions mean that usually there is a 
good bit of empty space between the front/back clip planes and the 
actual models since the molecules are not rectangular in shape and even 
if they were, a sphere bounding the rectangular box is used to position 
the front/back planes (so that viewing from different directions does 
not move the clip plane in and out).
