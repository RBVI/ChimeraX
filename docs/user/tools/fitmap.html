<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Fit in Map</h3>

<p>
<b>Fit in Map</b> locally optimizes the fit of
atomic coordinates into a density map or one density map into another.
The maps usually represent electron density, but other types of
<a href="volumeviewer.html">volume data</a> can also be used.
</p><p>
The command implementation,
<a href="../commands/fitmap.html"><b>fitmap</b></a>, also includes
some important features not available in the <b>Fit in Map</b> dialog:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../commands/fitmap.html#global">global search</a>
with random initial placement
<li><a href="../commands/fitmap.html#sequence">sequential fitting</a>
of multiple different structures
<li><a href="../commands/fitmap.html#symmetric">symmetric fitting</a>
of copies of the same structure
</ul>

<h3>Dialog and Basic Usage</h3>
<p>
<b>Fit in Map</b> can be started
from the <b>Volume Data</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu
(<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>). 
</p>
<a name="fitmodel"></a>
<a name="refmodel"></a>
<blockquote>
<b>Fit [&nbsp;<i>fit-model</i>&nbsp;] in map 
[&nbsp;<i>ref-model</i>&nbsp;]</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <i>fit-model</i> is the set of atoms or a
map (<a href="volumeviewer.html">volume data</a>)
to be fit into the <i>ref-model</i> map.
Each should be chosen from the pulldown menu of models already open in ChimeraX.
When atoms are fit, an entire atomic model or just the currently
<a href="../selection.html">selected</a> atoms can be used.
If an entire atomic model is chosen, any parts not desired for fitting
(such as solvent, ligands, or extra chains) should be
<a href="../commands/delete.html">deleted</a> from that model.
</p><p>
Since the <a href="#optimization">optimization</a> is local rather than global,
the fit model should be placed in a trial position
relative to the reference map before fitting.
This usually involves interactive manipulation with
<a href="../commands/ui.html#mousemode">mouse modes</a> that move
only the <a href="../selection.html">selected</a> model(s)
<a href="mousemodes.html" title="Mouse Modes for Right Button...">
<img class="icon" border=1 src="mouse-icons/move_h2o.png"></a>
<a href="mousemodes.html" title="Mouse Modes for Right Button...">
<img class="icon" border=1 src="mouse-icons/rotate_h2o.png"></a>
or the model that was clicked
<a href="mousemodes.html" title="Mouse Modes for Right Button...">
<img class="icon" border=1 src="mouse-icons/move_picked_model.png"></a>.
See <a href="../commands/ui.html#selective">selective manipulation</a>.
</p><p>
Only the current <a href="volumeviewer.html#region">display region</a>
(which may be a cropped rectangular box) of the <i>ref-model</i> map is used.
All of the grid points in the region are used at full resolution, 
regardless of what <a href="volumeviewer.html#step">step level</a> 
and <a href="volumeviewer.html#threshold">threshold</a> (contour level)
are used to display the <i>ref-model</i> map. 
However, for <a href="#fitmaps">map-in-map</a> fitting, the <i>fit-model</i>
map data are restricted by its step level, display region, 
and <a href="#options">optionally</a> its lowest threshold level.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Fit</b> performs
<a href="#optimization">local optimization</a> of the fit
(<a href="#fitatoms">atoms-in-map</a> or <a href="#fitmaps">map-in-map</a>)
using the current <a href="#options">options</a>.
The calculation will stop and the <a href="#fitmodel">fit model</a>
will be repositioned after the earliest of:
<ul>
<li><a href="#convergence">convergence</a>
<li>2000 steps
</ul>
<p>
The goodness-of-fit values <a href="#fitmaps"><b>Correlation</b></a> and/or 
<a href="#fitatoms"><b>Average map value</b></a> are reported in the dialog.
Clicking
<b>Update</b> gives the current fit values without performing any fitting.
</p><p>
The fit values, number of steps taken, and 
<a href="#fitmodel">fit model</a> displacement
(translational shift and angle of rotation) are reported in the
<a href="log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
The transformation of the <a href="#fitmodel">fit model</a>
relative to the <a href="#refmodel">reference map</a>
is described with a transformation matrix in which the
first three columns of the matrix describe a rotation 
and the fourth describes a translation (performed after the rotation). 
The transformation is also described as an axis of rotation (a unit vector), 
point on the axis, degrees of rotation, and shift parallel to the axis.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Fit</b> again may further improve the results,
especially if <a href="#convergence">convergence</a> was not reached.
<b>Undo</b> backtracks through transformations
of the <a href="#fitmodel">fit model</a> relative to the
<a href="#refmodel">reference map</a> applied by <b>Fit in Map</b>,
whereas <b>Redo</b> reapplies them.
</p><p>
The <a href="../commands/clashes.html"><b>clashes</b></a> command with
<a href="../commands/clashes.html#continuous"><b>continuous true</b></a>
can be used to monitor for close contacts between atomic structures
as they are moved, and atomic models can be
<a href="../commands/save.html#pdb">saved</a> in their positions
relative to the <a href="#refmodel">reference map</a>.

<b>Options</b>:

<ul>
<li> <b>Real-time correlation / average update</b>

<li> <b>Use map simulated from atoms, resolution</b> [<i>r</i>]

atoms will be used to calculate the fit.
</ul>
</p>

<a name="fitatoms">
Atoms-in-map fitting</a>:
<blockquote>
The average map value at fit atom positions is maximized.
For each atom within the bounds of the reference map,
the map value is found by trilinear interpolation
from the eight corners of the enclosing data grid cell.
Atoms outside the bounds of the map are not used for computing averages.
</blockquote>
<a name="fitmaps">
Map-in-map fitting</a>:
<blockquote>
Either the overlap or the correlation can be maximized.
The calculation can include all nonzero-valued fit map grid points
or only those with values above the map's lowest
<a href="volumeviewer.html#threshold">threshold level</a>
(see <a href="#options">options</a>).
The <a name="overlap"><b><i>overlap</i></b></a> is
the sum over fit map grid points of the product of the fit
map value and the reference map value at that point,
determined by trilinear interpolation.
It can be expressed as the inner product of
vectors <b>u</b> and <b>v</b> containing the fit map values
and the corresponding interpolated reference map values:
<blockquote>
<b><i>overlap</i></b> = &lt;<b>u</b>,<b>v</b>&gt;
</blockquote>
<a name="correlation">In similar notation</a>,
<blockquote>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td></td><td valign="bottom">
&lt;<b>u</b>,<b>v</b>&gt;
</td></tr>
<tr><td><b><i>correlation</i></b> =&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td height="1"><hr></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td valign="top">
|&nbsp;<b>u</b>&nbsp;||&nbsp;<b>v</b>&nbsp;|
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
or if the <a href="#aboutmean">correlation about mean</a> option is turned on,
<blockquote>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td></td><td valign="bottom">
&lt;<b>u</b>&ndash;<b>u</b><sub>ave</sub>,<b>v</b>&ndash;<b>v</b><sub>ave</sub>&gt;
</td></tr>
<tr><td><b><i>correlation</i></b> =&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td height="1"><hr></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td valign="top">
|<b>u</b>&ndash;<b>u</b><sub>ave</sub>||<b>v</b>&ndash;<b>v</b><sub>ave</sub>|
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
where <b>u</b><sub>ave</sub> is a vector with all components equal to the
average of the components of <b>u</b> and <b>v</b><sub>ave</sub> is
defined analogously.
The correlation equals the cosine of the angle between the vectors
(after subtraction of averages) and can range from &ndash;1 to 1, whereas
the range of overlap values depends on the scaling of the maps.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<a name="optimization">
<b>Local optimization algorithm</b>.</a>
If rotation and translation are both allowed, every even step is
a translation and every odd step is a rotation.
The center of rotation is the geometric center of the
fit atoms or fit map grid points, whichever applies.
Optimization is by steepest ascent.  Map value gradients at atom positions
or fit map points are calculated using trilinear interpolation
of the gradients at the reference map points.
Gradients at grid points are calculated by the center difference method.
Atoms or fit map points outside the reference map
or within one voxel of the edge of the data at a given step
do not contribute to the optimal direction at that step.
The initial step size is the largest (default 0.5 grid unit,
where a grid unit is the spacing between reference map grid points).
If after four steps the maximum cumulative displacement is less
than half the displacement achievable if all steps were in the same
direction (<i>e.g.</i>, half of 2.0 grid units = 1 grid unit),
the step size is halved.  Successive rounds of four steps with fixed
step size and halving the step size based on the maximum displacement
criterion are repeated until
<a name="convergence"><b><i>convergence</i></b></a>
(when step size falls below some minimum, default 0.01 grid unit)
or the number of steps reaches some maximum (default 2000).
Values other than the defaults can be specified with the
<a href="../commands/fitmap.html"><b>fitmap</b></a> command.
</p><p>
<b>Comparing fits</b>.
Because local optima rather than a global optimum are found,
it is often beneficial to explore and compare different fits.
This can be done by opening multiple copies of the fit model and
fitting them from different starting positions.
The <a href="modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>
can be used to hide and show individual copies.
</p><p>
<b>Clipping and hiding are ignored.</b>
The calculation uses full maps even if partly hidden by 
<a href="../commands/clip.html">clipping</a> or zoning
(with <a href="../commands/surface.html#zone"><b>surface zone</b></a>
or <a href="../commands/volume.html#zone"><b>volume zone</b></a>).
</p><p>
<b>Self-correlation &ne; 1</b>.
The correlation value
of a map with itself in the same position should equal 1.
However, in such cases, <b>Fit in Map</b> can report values much less than
1 because of floating-point rounding errors in grid point positions.
Grid points at the boundary of a map can be found to lie outside the map,
yielding interpolated values of 0.
</p><p>
<b>Speed</b>.
Calculation time is proportional to the number of fit atoms 
or fit map grid points.
Using a <a href="../selection.html">selection</a> of protein
&alpha;-carbons only, for example, 
will be substantially faster than using all atoms.
The optimization calculation is written partly in C++ for speed
and partly in Python.
