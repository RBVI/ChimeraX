</p>
<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>
<b>Segment Map</b> performs <b><i>watershed segmentation</i></b>:
a density map is partitioned so that each local maximum has its 
own region, and the boundaries between regions lie at the
valleys between the local maxima. The goal is usually
one region per protein or domain, but the initial segmentation 
often gives more numerous and smaller regions than desired, 
especially if the data are noisy.  
<a name="grouping"></a>
Segger provides various ways to combine regions after the initial segmentation:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#options">automatic grouping</a>
 by <b><i>scale-space filtering</i></b> 
(smoothing the data), done by default;
however, smoothing the data <i>before</i> segmentation
may be necessary, as discussed <a href="#preprocessing">below</a>
<li>interactive grouping <a href="#byhand">by manual selection</a>
<li>interactive grouping <a href="#byconnectivity">by connectivity</a>
<li>interactive grouping using fitted atomic models
</ul>

<a name="preprocessing"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: Segment Map</a>]
</p>
<h3>Preprocessing</h3>
<p>
It may be necessary to process a density map beforehand
for the segmentation to finish in a reasonable amount of time.
A map of size 256<sup>3</sup> can have a million local maxima if it is noisy.
Gaussian smoothing to reduce the number of local maxima
can be performed with the command
<a href="../commands/volume.html#gaussian"><b>volume gaussian</b></a>.
Gaussian filtering reduces resolution to about six times the Gaussian
standard deviation. 
After smoothing, it will also improve performance to reduce the size 
of the map with
<a href="../commands/volume.html#bin"><b>volume bin</b></a>.
For visualization and analysis, it is desirable
for a density map to be oversampled by three times in each dimension, 
so binning should aim for a grid spacing of approximately twice the 
Gaussian standard deviation.
</p><p>
If interactive rotation speed is poor after segmentation, see
<a href="#response">response time</a>.
</p>

<a name="dialog"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: Segment Map</a>]
</p>
<h3>Dialog and Basic Usage</h3>
<p>
<b>Segment Map</b> can be started
from the <b>Volume Data</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu
(<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
</p><p>
<a name="chosenmap"></a>
The map of interest should be chosen from the pulldown menu of open 
<a href="volumeviewer.html">volume data</a> sets next to <b>Segment map</b>. 
The <a href="volumeviewer.html#threshold">threshold</a>
(contour level) of the map should be adjusted
before segmentation, because the calculation will use only the voxels
with density values above that level.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Segment</b> partitions the chosen map by the watershed method plus
smoothing and grouping as specified in the 
<a href="#options">segmenting options</a>. 
The segmentation result is shown as a surface model
with one or more <b><i>segmentation regions</i></b>
of different colors. The resulting number of regions is reported in the 
dialog and the <a href="log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
The segmentation is given the same name as the corresponding map except
with <b>.seg</b> appended.
</p><p>
<a name="currseg">
The <b>Current segmentation</b> is indicated in the dialog and can be changed
by choosing a different segmentation name from the pulldown menu.
Designating a segmentation as the current segmentation
shows it and hides any others.
</a>
Grouping and ungrouping operations modify
the current segmentation model rather than creating a new one. 
However, multiple segmentation models can be open at the same time, 
and may have been generated from different density maps or opened from
previously <a href="#menu-file">saved</a> segmentation files.
</p><p>
<a name="byhand">Grouping and ungrouping</a> can be specified interactively
by <a href="../selection.html">selection</a>. With default
<a href="../commands/ui.html#mousemode">mouse-button assignments</a>,
Ctrl-click selects a region and Shift-Ctrl-click selects additional regions
without erasing the pre-existing selection.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If no segmentation regions are selected,
clicking <b>Ungroup</b> backtracks to the previous stage of grouping of the
<a href="#currseg">current segmentation</a>. By <a href="#options">default</a>, 
<b>Segment</b> automatically applies multiple rounds of smoothing 
and grouping, so that different intermediate stages can be accessed 
by clicking <b>Ungroup</b> multiple times. If regions are selected,
<b>Ungroup</b> will backtrack to the previous stage of grouping for
the selected region(s).
<li>If no segmentation regions are selected,
<b>Group</b> traverses the stages in the opposite direction as <b>Ungroup</b>,
or performs further grouping.
If regions are selected,
<b>Group</b> will combine the selected regions into a single group.
</ul>
<p>
Segmentation region <a href="../selection.html">selection</a>, showing/hiding,
and other manipulations can also be performed with the
<a href="#shortcuts">shortcuts options</a> or the
<b>Segment Map</b> <a href="#menu-regions"><b>Regions</b> menu</a>.
</p><p>
Segmentation results are included in saved
<a href="../commands/save.html#session">sessions</a>. 
They can also be saved separately using the <b>Segment Map</b> 
<a href="#menu-file"><b>File</b> menu</a>
or the <a href="../commands/save.html"><b>save</b></a> command.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Fit</b> opens the 
<a href="fitsegments.html"><b>Fit to Segments</b></a> tool.
Clicking <b>Help</b> shows 
this page in the <a href="helpviewer.html"><b>Help Viewer</b></a>.
</p>

<a name="options"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: Segment Map</a>]
</p>
<p>
<b>Segmenting Options</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="maxreg"></a><a name="granularity"></a>
<b>Display at most [<i>maxreg</i>] regions, granularity 
[<i>triangle-size</i>] voxels</b>
&ndash; limit the number of displayed regions
to <i>maxreg</i> (default <b>60</b> largest) and set surface
<i>triangle-size</i> (default <b>1</b>).
If more regions than <i>maxreg</i> are generated, however,
those which are not displayed will still be included in
subsequent smoothing and grouping calculations.
Smaller surface triangles give a smoother appearance,
but more triangles take longer to render. The default <i>triangle-size</i>
of <b>1</b> gives triangles comparable in size to the map grid spacing.  
A value of 2 will make the triangles twice as large (quadruple the area) 
and reduce their number by about a factor of 4.
If <a href="#response">response time</a> after segmentation is slow, try
decreasing <i>maxreg</i> and/or increasing <i>triangle-size</i>.
<br><br>
<li><b>Keep regions having at least [<i>minsize</i>] voxels, 
[<i>mincontact</i>] contact voxels</b>
&ndash; throw out regions containing fewer than <i>minsize</i> voxels 
(default <b>1</b>) or having fewer than
<i>mincontact</i> contact voxels (default <b>0</b>) with other regions.
These apply only to the initial segmentation, not after smoothing.
The default settings retain all regions.
<br><br>
<li><b>Group by smoothing [<i>N</i>] steps of size [<i>M</i>],
stop at [<i>minreg</i>] regions</b>
&ndash; whether to group by smoothing right after watershed segmentation
(when the <b>Segment</b> button is clicked),
and if so, how many rounds of automatic smoothing and grouping to perform 
(default <i>N</i>=<b>4</b>) and how much smoothing to perform at each round
(default <i>M</i>=<b>1</b>).
If a round would give fewer than <i>minreg</i> regions (default <b>1</b>),
the process is backtracked to the previous round of automatic grouping.
Grouping by smoothing is on by default and mutually exclusive with
<a href="#byconnectivity">grouping by connectivity</a>.
<p>
If <i>L</i> is the minimum of the grid spacing along the three axes,
the standard deviation of the Gaussian used for smoothing
will be <i>M</i>x<i>L</i> in the first round and increase
by <i>M</i>x<i>L</i> in each subsequent round.
A single round consists of smoothing the data, then letting each 
local maximum point from the previous round move by steepest ascent 
to the location of a new local maximum.
If two or more previous maxima converge on a new maximum,
their regions from the previous round are coalesced into a single region.
In general, the number of rounds <i>N</i> is the dominant parameter to adjust
when fewer, larger regions are desired. A larger step size <i>M</i> may be 
beneficial for noisier maps. However, a smaller step size gives more gradual 
changes per round, thus more rounds to achieve a similar end result, and more 
intermediate stages that can be traversed with the
<b>Group</b> and <b>Ungroup</b> buttons. 
After the automatic rounds have completed, clicking <b>Group</b>
executes the minimum number of additional rounds needed to
change the grouping further. 
</p>
<li><a name="byconnectivity"></a>
<b>Group by connectivity [<i>N</i>] steps, stop at [<i>minreg</i>] regions</b>
&nbsp;<b>&#9744; only visible</b>
&ndash; whether to group watershed regions based on density connections,
and if so, whether to use only the visible regions.
If the density map has not been segmented already, watershed
segmentation will use only the voxels with density values above
the current <a href="volumeviewer.html#threshold">threshold</a>
without subsequent smoothing/grouping. Clicking <b>Group</b>
will then perform the specified number of rounds (steps) of
grouping by connectivity (default <i>N</i>=<b>20</b>).
Each round corresponds to one pass through contact list.
If a round would give fewer than <i>minreg</i> regions (default <b>1</b>),
the process is backtracked to the previous round.
If grouping has already been performed, 
some ungrouping may be needed before using the connectivity method, 
as it will not group watershed regions together if they are already 
in different groups.

<h3>Segmentation Region Attributes</h3>
<p>
Segmentation <a href="#top">segmentation regions</a> are automatically
assigned several <a href="../attributes.html">attributes</a>.
These attributes can be inspected and new attributes assigned
using the <b>Region Attributes</b> dialog, opened by choosing <b>Regions...
Attributes table</b> from the <a href="#menu"><b>Segment Map</b> menu</a>.
Segmentation regions can be specified in commands
<a href="../commands/atomspec.html#attributes">by attribute value</a>.
colored or <a href="../selection.html">selected</a> 
based on their attribute values using the
<a href="../render/render.html"><b>Render/Select by Attribute</b></a> tool.
See also:
<a href="../defineattrib/defineattrib.html"><b>Define Attribute</b></a>,
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/measure.html#spine"><b>measure spine</b></a>
</p><p>
In the <b>Region Attributes</b> dialog,
each row is a region, and each column is an attribute that can be 
shown or hidden using the <b>Columns</b> menu.
The table can be sorted by the values in any displayed column by
clicking the column header.  Clicking the header once sorts the entries
in order of increasing value and places an up arrowhead (triangle)
in the header.  Clicking again sorts the entries in decreasing
order and places a down arrowhead (inverted triangle) in the header.
</p><p>
<a name="chosen">
One or more regions (rows) in the table 
can be chosen with the left mouse button.</a>
A contiguous block of rows can be chosen by dragging, or by
clicking on the first (or last) line and then <b>Shift</b>-clicking on the
last (or first).  <b>Ctrl</b>-click toggles the status of a single line.  
Choosing a region in the table
<a href="../selection.html">selects</a> it, and
<a href="../selection.html">selecting</a> a region in the
graphics window will center and highlight the corresponding row in the table.
</p><p>
The automatically created attributes are read-only:
<ul>
<li><b>region</b> &ndash; region ID number
<li><b>grid points</b> &ndash; number of density map grid points within the region
<li><b>grouped</b> &ndash; number of regions grouped to form the region
(next level in hierarchy, not necessarily the number of watershed regions)
<li><b>has surface</b> &ndash; 1 if a surface has been made (not necessarily shown)
for the region
<li><b>contacts</b> &ndash; number of contacting regions
<li><b>edge distance</b> &ndash; number of voxels to the nearest edge
of the density map
<li><b>bounds</b> (hidden by default) &ndash; grid indices bounding the region: 
i_min, j_min, k_min, i_max, j_max, k_max
</ul>
New attributes for the chosen region(s)
can be created or their values changed using:
<ul>
<li><b>Set attribute</b> [<i>attr_name</i>] <b>to value</b> [<i>attr_value</i>]
<b>or</b> [<b>snapshot</b>]
</ul>
Region attribute values can be integers,
floating point numbers, text strings, or images, and a given attribute
(column) can have multiple types of values, although only one per region (row).
An <i>attr_value</i> can be entered, or the
<b>snapshot</b> button clicked to set the value to an image of the
graphics window.  An image can be shown at full size by
clicking its miniature version in the table, and saved as PNG, JPEG, or TIFF
using the <b>Save</b> button on the full-size view.
</p><p>
The table can filtered to show only the rows meeting some attribute criterion:
<ul>
<li><b>Filter list</b> [<i>criterion</i>]
</ul>
The <i>criterion</i> is specified in Python syntax.  Examples:
<blockquote>
grid_points &gt; 1500
<br>
note
<br>
contacts == 0 and note and "good" in note
</blockquote>
where the second would list only regions with an attribute named <b>note</b>
and the third would list only regions that are not in contact with other regions
and that have an attribute named <b>note</b> containing the word <b>good</b>.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Update</b> refreshes the <b>Region Attributes</b> dialog 
to reflect any changes in the <a href="#currseg">current segmentation</a> 
or its groupings.
</p><p>
The contents (excluding images) of the rows and columns currently shown 
in the filtered table can be saved in a comma-separated format using
<b>File... Export</b> in the <b>Region Attributes</b> dialog menu.
All of the attributes (including images) 
can be saved along with other segmentation information 
using <b>File... Save Segmentation</b>
in the <a href="#menu"><b>Segment Map</b> menu</a>.
