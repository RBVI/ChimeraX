<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Cage Builder</h3>
<p>
<b>Cage Builder</b> 
creates polyhedral cages composed of hexagons and pentagons.
Atomic models can be <a href="#placing">placed</a>
on the cages to create oligomeric molecular assemblies
using the <a href="../commands/sym.html"><b>sym</b></a> command.
See also: <a href="../commands/hkcage.html"><b>hkcage</b></a>
</p><p>
The <b>Cage Builder</b> tool
can be opened from the <b>Higher-Order Structure</b> section of the
<b>Tools</b> menu and manipulated like other panels
(<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type:none">
<b>Create polygon [ 5 ][ 6 ]</b>
&ndash; clicking a number attaches a new polygon with that number of
sides to each currently <a href="../selection.html">selected</a>
polygon edge, or if no such edges exist, creates a single new polygon.
The polygons are added as a <a href="../markers.html">marker model</a>
named <b>Cage</b>. The attached edges are automatically <b><i>joined</i></b>.
Joined edges are shown in lighter colors than unjoined edges.
</ul>
<p>
Clicking <b>Minimize</b> improves the alignment of joined edges.
This is typically done after some rounds of new polygon attachment.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Delete</b> removes entire polygons that contain any
<a href="../selection.html">selected</a> edge or vertex.

<h3>Placing Atomic Models on Cages</h3>
<p>
Copies of atomic models can be placed on the polygons using the
<a href="../commands/sym.html"><b>sym</b></a> command.
</p><p>
For example, one might want to put a single copy of the structure
at each pentagon (ignoring any other types of polygons).
First, the molecular model would need to be positioned as desired relative
to one of the pentagons in the cage model.
Then, if the molecule model is #2 and the cage
model is #1, the following would place a copy
of the molecule model at an equivalent position relative to each pentagon:
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:
<b><a href="../commands/sym.html">sym</a> #2 #1,p5</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
The copies can be removed with
<a href="../commands/sym.html#clear"><b>sym clear</b></a>.
</p><p>
Another possibility is to place multiple copies per polygon. For example,
after a molecule model #2 has been positioned relative to (1/6) of a hexagon
in cage model #1, the following would use C<sub>6</sub> symmetry about the
hexagon center to place six copies per hexagon:
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:
<b><a href="../commands/sym.html">sym</a>
#2 #1,pn6 surfaceOnly true</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <b>surfaceOnly</b> option specifies creating low-resolution
surfaces instead of atomic copies (for faster rendering).
</p><p>
Currently there is no good way to refine the molecular positions
to make the interfaces between molecules physically realistic.
