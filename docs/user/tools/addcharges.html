<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Add Charges</h3>
<p>
<b>Add Charges</b> assigns atomic partial charges and Amber/GAFF atom types
as the <a href="../attributes.html">attributes</a>
<b>charge</b> and <b>gaffType</b>, respectively.
The command implementation is
<a href="../commands/addcharge.html"><b>addcharge</b></a>.
It may be helpful to run
<a href="../commands/dockprep.html"><b>dockprep</b></a> beforehand
to fix any truncated amino acid sidechains.

<li>Standard residues (water, standard amino acids, standard nucleic acids,
certain lipids, and a few common variants and capping groups) are assigned

  <ul>
  <li>protein: ff14SB

Explicit hydrogens are required for charge assignment;
<a href="addhydrogens.html"><b>Add Hydrogens</b></a>
will be called as needed.
</p>
<ul>
<a name="nonstandard"></a>
<li>If other nonstandard residue types are present, another dialog will 
appear for specifying the <b>Net Charge</b> of each. 
Initial values are guessed, but can be changed as needed. 
Names of the form RES1+RES2 indicate covalently bonded residues
that will be treated as a single unit, and the net charge is for the
combined entity. Monatomic ions are simply assigned their 
net charges, whereas atomic partial charges and
<a href="https://ambermd.org/antechamber/gaff.html#atomtype"
target="_blank">GAFF types</a>
for the remaining (multiatomic) nonstandard residues are calculated by
<a href="https://ambermd.org/antechamber/antechamber.html"
target="_blank"><b>Antechamber</b></a>, which is included with ChimeraX.
The method of charge calculation can be either of the following:
</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>AM1-BCC</b> &ndash; semi-empirical (AM1)
  with bond charge correction (BCC), parametrized to reproduce
  <i>ab initio</i> (HF/6-31G*) electrostatic potentials
  <li><b>Gasteiger</b> &ndash; iterative partial equalization of orbital
  electronegativity, a faster method based on atom types and connectivity
 </ul>
<p>
While both methods are much faster than <i>ab initio</i> calculations,
the Gasteiger method is the faster and more approximate of the two.
</p><p>
<b>Note</b>: Antechamber/GAFF are meant to handle most small organic molecules,
but not metal complexes, inorganic compounds, or unstable species such as
radicals, and may not work well on highly charged molecules.
GAFF allows for parametrization of most organic molecules made of
C, N, O, H, S, P, F, Cl, Br and I. Publications using results from

<h3>Troubleshooting Charge Addition</h3>
<p>
Potentially ambiguous or rare (shifted-pKa) protonation states,
especially in binding sites and nonstandard residues,
should be verified and corrected before charges are assigned.
For example,
extra hydrogens can be <a href="../commands/delete.html">deleted</a>,
and <a href="../atomtypes.html">atom types</a> can be edited
(before hydrogen addition)
with <a href="../commands/setattr.html"><b>setattr</b></a>
or <a href="buildstructure.html"><b>Build Structure</b></a>.
</p><p>
An unrecognized atom name in a standard residue will cause an error,
and if the net charge of a model is not an integer, a warning will be issued.
Cases of unrecognized atoms in standard residues and/or incorrect net charges
should be examined and resolved.
</p><p>
The <a href="../commands/dockprep.html"><b>dockprep</b></a> command
allows repairing truncated amino acid sidechains, one common cause
of non-integral net charges, before adding hydrogens and charges.
Standard residues with missing or extra atoms can be identified 
in the command line as
<a href="../commands/atomspec.html#builtin"><b>template-mismatch</b></a>,
for example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>label template-mismatch height 2 color red</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that chain-terminal nucleotide residues will normally
have non-integral charges, but the 5' and 3' charges sum to an integer.
</p><p>
Atoms can be labeled with their partial charges by using the menu
(<a href="../menu.html#actlabel"><b>Actions...  Label... Atoms... 
Other... Charge</b></a>) or the 
<a href="../commands/label.html"><b>label</b></a> command, for example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>label ligand atoms attribute charge</b>
