<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Measure Volume and Area</h3>
<p>
<b>Measure Volume and Area</b> reports the total surface area 
(sum of triangle areas) and enclosed volume of a surface model.
All types of surface models are handled,
including <a href="volumeviewer.html">volume data</a> isosurfaces.
To measure individual disconnected blobs within a single surface model,
see <a href="measureblobs.html"><b>Measure and Color Blobs</b></a>
<a href="mousemodes.html" title="Right Mouse Toolbar...">
<img class="icon" border="1" src="mouse-icons/pickblobs.png" alt="computer generated image"></a>.
To measure the
<a href="../commands/surface.html#surfdefs">solvent-accessible surface area</a>
of an atomic structure, the command
<a href="../commands/measure.html#sasa"><b>measure sasa</b></a>
should be used instead.
See also: <a href="volumeviewer.html"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>,
<a href="../commands/measure.html#area"><b>measure area</b></a>,
<a href="../commands/measure.html#volume"><b>measure volume</b></a>,
<a href="../commands/surface.html#splitbycolor"><b>surface splitbycolor</b></a>,
<a href="../measurements.html">measurements</a>
</p><p>
<b>Measure Volume and Area</b> can be started 
from the <b>Volume Data</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu.
The tool window can be
<a href="../window.html#panels">moved, resized, <i>etc.</i></a>
</p><p>
The <b>Surface</b> of interest should be chosen from the list 
of available surfaces.
The surface area and enclosed volume are reported in the dialog
in the physical units of the data, typically
&Aring;<sup>3</sup> for volume and &Aring;<sup>2</sup> for area.
</p><p>
Surfaces are composed of triangles.
Anything that changes the positions of the vertices in a surface
will change its area and enclosed volume, for example:
</p><ul>
<li>adjusting the contour level of an isosurface shown with
<a href="volumeviewer.html"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>
</li><li>changing the probe radius or other calculation parameter of a
<a href="../commands/surface.html">molecular surface</a>
</li></ul>
<b>Update automatically</b> (on by default) indicates volume and area
should be recomputed automatically whenever such a change occurs.
Otherwise, a new calculation can be triggered  by clicking <b>Update</b>.
<p></p><p>
Clicking <b>Help</b> shows this page

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<b>Includes some hidden parts of surfaces.</b>
<br>
<b>Measure Volume and Area</b> includes parts of surfaces that have been 
hidden with <a href="../commands/surface.html#dust"><b>surface dust</b></a>,
<a href="../commands/surface.html#zone"><b>surface zone</b></a>,
or <a href="../commands/volume.html#zone"><b>volume zone</b></a>
(with <b>minimalBounds false</b>).
The command <a href="../commands/measure.html#area"><b>measure area</b></a> or
<a href="../commands/measure.html#volume"><b>measure volume</b></a>
can be used with <b>includeMasked false</b> to omit these hidden parts.
However, regardless of the <b>includeMasked</b> option, surface parts 
hidden by <a href="../commands/clip.html">clipping</a> are always used, 
whereas parts of a map that have been cropped away are never used;
only the current <a href="../tools/volumeviewer.html#region">display region</a>
of a map is used.
</p>
<p>
<b>Surface holes.</b>
<br>
The volume enclosed by a surface with holes is calculated by assuming
each hole has a planar cap. These caps are not displayed or included in
the surface area determination. The number of holes is reported, as
planar caps may not represent missing data very well.
Holes in a <a href="volumeviewer.html">volume data</a> isosurface
may occur at the boundary of the data,
but <a href="../commands/volume.html#capFaces">by default</a> 
these will already be covered with planar caps.
Such boundary caps will be included in
the surface area calculation and will not be reported as holes.
