<h3>Markers and Links</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <b><i>marker</i></b> is a pseudoatom, typically used to mark the position
of some feature within <a href="tools/volumeviewer.html">volume data</a>;
markers are implemented as atoms, so actions that apply to
atoms in ChimeraX also apply to markers:
they can be <a href="commands/atomspec.html">specified</a> in commands,
<a href="selection.html">selected</a>, <i>etc.</i>
<!--
<li>A <b><i>marker note</i></b> is a text label on a marker, analogous to
an atom label.
-->
<li>A <b><i>link</i></b> is a connection between markers, analogous to a bond.
<li>A <b><i>marker set</i></b> is a model that consists of markers and links,
analogous to an atomic model.
</ul>
<p>
Markers and links can be created and adjusted
<a href="commands/ui.html#mousemode">with the mouse</a>
(see <a href="tools/markerplacement.html"><b>Marker Placement</b></a>)
or the <a href="commands/marker.html"><b>marker</b></a> command.
Markers placed on <a href="trajectories.html#vseries">volume series</a> data
are assigned a <a href="attributes.html#atom"><b>frame</b> attribute</a>
with value indicating the associated time step within the series.
Various other commands such as <a href="commands/bumps.html"><b>bumps</b></a>,
<a href="commands/measure.html#center"><b>measure center</b></a>,
<a href="commands/define.html#centroid"><b>define centroid</b></a>,
and <a href="commands/vseries.html#measure"><b>vseries measure</b></a>
may also create them to show the results of calculations.
</p><p>
Markers and links can be saved to and read from 
<a href="#markerfiles">marker files</a>.
Markers and links are shown in the <a href="commands/style.html">ball style</a>
when initially created 
with <a href="tools/markerplacement.html"><b>Marker Placement</b></a>
and when read from a marker file.
They can also be <a href="commands/save.html">saved</a> 
to atomic-coordinate file types such as PDB,
but may not be interpretable as molecules upon input (to any program).

<h3>Marker Files</h3>
<p>
Marker file format (.cmm) is the same in ChimeraX as in Chimera.
It includes marker set name(s), marker positions, marker notes,
links, colors, and radii.
<!--
(but not
<a href="#smooth">smooth paths</a> or <a href="#surfaces">surfaces</a>).
-->
<font color="brown">
However, ChimeraX does not save labels on markers as marker notes,
and marker notes are not shown as labels when read from a file.</font>
Marker files can be opened and saved using the <b>File</b> menu
or the commands <a href="commands/open.html"><b>open</b></a> and
<a href="commands/save.html"><b>save</b></a>, respectively.
</p><p>
The format is actually XML, plain text that can be read or created
by other programs or &ldquo;manually&rdquo; in a text editor.
Libraries for parsing XML are available in many programming languages.
The following marker file describes two markers connected by a link:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;marker_set name="marker set 1"&gt;
&lt;marker id="1" x="-6.1267" y="17.44" z="-3.1338"  radius="0.35217"/&gt;
&lt;marker id="2" x="1.5395" y="16.277" z="-3.0339" r="0" g="1" b="1"
               radius="0.5" note="An example note"/&gt;
&lt;link id1="2" id2="1" r="1" g="1" b="0" radius="0.17609"/&gt;
&lt;/marker_set&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The <b>r</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>b</b> attributes are red, green,
and blue color components, respectively, with possible values ranging
from 0 to 1.
</p><p>
Extra XML attributes can be specified within the marker, link, and marker_set
tags, as a mechanism for retaining information from or passing information to
other programs. For example, the following marker description
includes <b>nr</b>, <b>ng</b>, <b>nb</b>, and <b>frame</b> attributes:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;marker id="3" x="195.43" y="166.62" z="174.03" r="1" g="1" b="0" radius="5"
 note="cap domain" nr="1" ng="1" nb="0" frame="5"/&gt;
</pre>
<a name="frame"></a>
<p>
The <a href="attributes.html#atom"><b>frame</b> attribute</a>
is used for markers on <a href="trajectories.html#vseries">volume series</a>;
it gives the associated time step for synchronized playback with
<a href="commands/vseries.html#play"><b>vseries play</b></a>.
Whereas <b>frame</b> and <b>radius</b> are assigned as
<a href="attributes.html#atom">atom attributes</a> and notes are currently
ignored, the remaining XML attributes are not assigned as atom attributes
but kept in a Python dictionary called <b>marker_extra_attributes</b>.
These extra attributes are remembered in 
<a href="commands/save.html#session">sessions</a>
and included when a marker file is <a href="commands/save.html">saved</a>.
