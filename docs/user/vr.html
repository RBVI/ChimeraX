Any models displayed in ChimeraX can be shown in virtual reality headsets
supported by <a href="http://steamvr.com">SteamVR</a>, such as HTC Vive, 
Oculus Rift and Samsung Odyssey.
Descriptions here are for Vive hand controllers, but other hand controllers
have buttons that are generally similar in position and function.
</p><p>
Vive controllers each have a <b><i>trigger</i></b>
to &ldquo;pull&rdquo; with the index finger,
a <b><i>grip</i></b> button on the side,
and a larger round <b><i>trackpad</i></b> on the top surface
that can be pressed with the thumb.
Above the trackpad is a smaller <b><i>menu</i></b> button
marked with horizontal lines, and below it is a power button and
a green light indicating when the controller is turned on.

</ol>

</p><p>

The hand-controller positions are shown in the headset as cones,
and icons on the cones indicate button functions

<p>
The control panel is just the ChimeraX desktop user interface 
(by <a href="commands/device.html#vr">default</a>,
the righthand panel of tool windows). Displaying this panel in the
headset allows &ldquo;clicking&rdquo; normal desktop controls
such as to <a href="#displayicons">adjust the display</a> 
and to <a href="#mousemodes">reassign modes</a>.
</p><p>
The physical room bounds are shown
with blue squares when the headset or a hand controller 
comes close to a physical wall (within about a meter).
Models can be scaled to sizes larger than the physical room.
</p><p>
To turn off rendering in the VR headset and re-enable rendering on the 
desktop display, use the ChimeraX command:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="commands/device.html#vr"><b>vr off</b></a>
</blockquote>

<a name="mousemodes"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: Virtual Reality</a>]
</p>
<h3>Hand-Controller Modes</h3>
<p>
Most of the ChimeraX &ldquo;mouse&rdquo;
<a href="tools/mousemodes.html">modes</a>
(function assignments) can be used with the VR hand controllers.
To assign a function to a hand-controller button:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the Vive <b><i>menu</i></b> button to show the ChimeraX control panel
with <a href="tools/toolbar.html"><b>Toolbar</b></a> icons in the headset. 
Icons in the <a href="tools/mousemodes.html"><b>Right Mouse</b></a> tab 
are used to assign modes:
<br><img class="iconbar" src="mouse-icons.png">
<br><br>
<li>Put the tip of a hand controller cone on a 
<a href="tools/mousemodes.html">mode icon</a> and click with the
<b><i>trigger</i></b>, <b><i>trackpad</i></b>, or <b><i>grip</i></b> button
to reassign that button to the function;
the icon will pop up slightly when the cone tip is in position to click it.
</ol>
<p>
There are three assignable buttons on each controller, so six modes 
can be assigned. However, leaving the <b><i>triggers</i></b> with their
default assignments
(rotation, translation, zooming) is recommended to allow manipulation
as described <a href="#default-controller">above</a>.
If a <b><i>trigger</i></b> is accidentally reassigned, using it to click
either the <b>rotate</b>
&nbsp;<img class="icon" border=1 src="tools/mouse-icons/rotate.png">&nbsp;
or <b>translate</b>
&nbsp;<img class="icon" border=1 src="tools/mouse-icons/translate.png">&nbsp;
mode icon returns it to the default behavior.
</p><p>
Functions are described in more detail in the 
<a href="tools/mousemodes.html"><b>Right Mouse</b></a> icons page, but include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="selection.html">select</a>
  <li>rotate + translate (single mode in VR)
   &ndash; default/recommended for <b><i>triggers</i></b>
  <li>zoom &ndash; default for <b><i>trackpad</i></b>
  <li>rotate and translate <a href="selection.html">selected</a> models only
  <li>move clip planes
  <li>rotate clip planes
  <li>measure distances between atoms or markers
  <li>label residues
  <li>set pivot to atom
  <li>rotate bond
  <li>change map contour level
  <li>view map planes
  <li>crop map box
  <li>place markers, move, resize, delete, connnect markers
  <li>play 3D image time series
  <li>tug on atoms with molecular dynamics
  <li>run molecular dynamics on residue and neighbors
  <li>swap an amino acid
  <li>limit atomic and map display to a zone around a residue
  <li>&ldquo;windowing&rdquo; 
   &ndash; adjust volume image display thresholds collectively
</ul>

<p>
  Modes that require clicking on an atom such as selection or labeling require pointing at the atom
  with the hand controller cone.  This is easiest to do at close range, although it can work at a distance
  but requires accurate pointing.  Modes that involve dragging on the desktop such as changing the contour
  level of a map or zooming are operated by clicking and moving the hand controller vertically.  The bond
  rotation mouse mode operates by dragging on the desktop, but in VR operates by rotating the hand controller.
  Translation and rotation are separate mouse modes but are a single hand controller mode.
</p>

<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: Virtual Reality</a>]
</p>
<h3>Changing the Display</h3>
<p>
Molecule or map display (styles, <i>etc.</i>)
can be changed by displaying the ChimeraX
control panel in the headset using the Vive controller <b><i>menu</i></b>
button, then using the hand controllers to &ldquo;click&rdquo;
<a href="tools/toolbar.html"><b>Toolbar</b></a> icons:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="tools/moldisplay.html"><b>Molecule Display</b></a>:&nbsp;
<img class="iconbar" src="molecule-icons.png">
<li><a href="tools/densitymaps.html"><b>Map</b></a>:&nbsp;
<img class="iconbar" src="density-icons.png">
</ul>
<p>
An icon will pop up slightly when the cone tip is in position to click it.
The scope of action of these icons can be limited by
<a href="selection.html">selection</a>.
</p><p>
Alternatively, the display can be changed by removing the headset and using
the ChimeraX interface on the conventional display with mouse and keyboard.

</p>
<h3>Limitations of Interactive Viewing</h3>
<p>
<font color="red" size="+1"><b>Motion sickness warning</b></font>:
If the model is stuttering or flickering in the headset
(due to insufficient rendering speed), then you should stop viewing it,
as this can easily and suddenly induce nausea that could last as long as
24 hours. Even without the stuttering, 
if you feel any motion sickness, stop using the headset.
Progression from slight nausea to needing to throw up can happen quickly.
</p>

<p>
<b>Operating systems</b>. 
We have tested ChimeraX VR on Windows 10 with an Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 
graphics card and with an AMD Radeon RX 480 graphics card.
As of November 2018, SteamVR works well on Windows on Windows 10,
has <a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/data/mac-vr-nov2018/mac-vr.html">some support on macOS</a> High Sierra and Mojave,
and can <a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/data/linux-vr-oct2018/linuxvr.html">work on Linux</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Small models only</b>.
Large molecular structures (more than a few thousand atoms) render too slowly
and will cause stuttering in the headset.
Large density map surfaces also cause stuttering;
a 200<sup>3</sup> map at full resolution should work, but larger sizes 
may require <a href="tools/volumeviewer.html#step">subsampling</a> (step 2).
Current headsets render at 90 frames per second in two eyes,
so the effective rendering speed needed to avoid flickering is about 
200 frames per second. By comparison, a rendering speed of 10 frames
per second is adequate on a conventional desktop display.
</p>
<p>
<b>Simple lighting</b>.
By default ChimeraX switches to simple lighting when VR is enabled &ndash; other
<a href="commands/lighting.html">lighting modes</a> render too slowly and cause stuttering.
</p><p>
<b>Desktop rendering</b>.
The ChimeraX graphics on your normal computer display will show what the user
sees in the VR headset. Rendering to the conventional display
(generally 60 frames per second) can slow the VR rendering if ChimeraX is not
able to switch to a mode where graphics is not synchronized to vertical refresh.
To test if this is the cause of stuttering you can use the 
<a href="commands/device.html#vr"><b>vr</b></a> command option
<b>display blank</b> to prevent graphics from updating on the desktop display.
An alternative mirroring can be done by the SteamVR runtime using
SteamVR menu entry &ldquo;Mirror Display.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<b>Side View should be closed</b>.
The ChimeraX <a href="tools/sideview.html"><b>Side View</b></a> tool 
will slow headset rendering and cause stuttering, so it
should be closed during VR viewing.
</p>

<p><b>Blackout.</b> 
Modes that perform calculations taking longer than 1/90th second cause the 
graphics not to update, and the VR scene will gray out after a fraction 
of a second without graphics updates. Changing map contour level and 
running molecular dynamics are prone to this problem.
In the future these calculations will be done in parallel 
so the graphics will not be slowed down.
</p>
<p><b>Flickering labels.</b>
Atom or residue labels can cause scene flicker because labels are 
slow to render. To make this less likely,
the frequency of <a href="commands/label.html#orient">label reoriention</a>
is automatically decreased when VR is enabled.
</p>
<p><b>Selection outlines.</b>
Green <a href="selection.html">selection</a>
outlines can slow rendering and cause flicker.
</p>

<p>
<b>Clipping when models far away</b>.
If models are scaled to a very large size, parts more than 
500 meters away (in physical room dimensions) will be clipped.  
This may seem like a large distance, but as a model is scaled up
it may appear to stop increasing in size because
stereoscopic depth perception is not effective beyond about 10 meters.
As parts of the model get both larger and farther away at the same rate, 
the change in size is not evident.
To gauge model size, it can be useful to move a hand controller near 
a physical wall so that the blue mesh will provide a reference distance.
</p>

<p>
<b>Dynamic scenes may render too slowly.</b>
Dynamic (time-varying) scenes are more interesting to view than static scenes.
We have successfully displayed 3D optical microscopy time series of crawling 
cells using the command
<a href="commands/vseries.html#play"><b>vseries play</b></a>
with the <a href="commands/vseries.html#cacheFrames"><b>cacheFrames</b></a>
option so that all surface depictions are precomputed;
without that option, the VR headset rendering is too slow.
It may also help to change the scene at a slower pace, 
for example using 
<a href="commands/vseries.html#play"><b>vseries play</b></a> with the 
<a href="commands/vseries.html#maxFrameRate"><b>maxFrameRate</b></a> option.
A molecular dynamics trajectories can be played with the
<a href="commands/coordset.html"><b>coordset</b></a> command.  Use the
coordset <b>pauseFrames 9</b> option to slow the playback rate from the
90 frames per second of the headset to 10 frames per second.
</p>

<p>
  <b>SteamVR room boundaries wrong.</b>
  Sometimes tracing room boundaries using room-scale room setup in SteamVR produces
  incorrect results (November 2018).
  We have observed this when the traced space is not a simple rectangle because of a desk
  against one wall.  Tracing around the desk joins the 6 corners of the bounds in
  the wrong order -- a different order than they were traced.  It is unclear what is wrong
  with the SteamVR room setup algorithm.  But we have found that clicking the room tracing
  "Advanced Mode" checkbutton which allows you to click at each corner of the room reliably
  produces the correct SteamVR bounds.
