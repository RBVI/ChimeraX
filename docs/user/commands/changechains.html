The command <b>changechains</b> changes the chain identifiers (IDs) of
residues containing the specified atoms. 
The corresponding tool is <a href="../tools/changechains.html"><b>Change
Chain IDs</b></a>.
See also: 
<a href="renumber.html"><b>renumber</b></a>,
<a href="rename.html"><b>rename</b></a>,
<a href="build.html"><b>build</b></a>,
<a href="combine.html"><b>combine</b></a>,
<a href="save.html#pdb"><b>save</b></a>
</p><p>
Either a single desired chain ID can be given, or
a comma-separated list of current IDs followed by a comma-separated list
of the desired IDs. 
</p><p>
If lists are used, they must contain equal numbers of IDs, 
which will be paired in the order given. Ranges of IDs cannot be given.
Within the set of specified atoms, occurrences of the Nth chain ID in the 
first list will be changed to the Nth ID in the second list.
The same ID may appear in both lists; the first list is only evaluated before 
the changes are made.
</p><p>
Capitalization of the IDs is important and will be used exactly as entered.
</p><p>
The command <b>changechains glycosylations</b> will look for HET chains
(typically glycosylations)
that are covalently bonded to the specified (non-HET) biopolymer chains
and change their IDs as needed to match the corresponding bonded chain. 
As per the usual convention, a blank specification means &ldquo;all.&rdquo;
</p><p>
For example, PDB entry <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6OEJ"
target="_blank">6oej</a> has glycosylation chain D on protein chain H 
and glycosylation chain E on protein chain B. The other glycosylations 
in the structure are single-residue and already have the same chain IDs as 
their attached proteins (A and G). The following would change D to H
and E to B in 6oej, making all glycosylations in the structure have
the same chain IDs as their attached proteins:
