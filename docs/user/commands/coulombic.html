The <b>coulombic</b> command calculates Coulombic electrostatic potential
(ESP) on the fly (no input ESP file required)
and uses it to color <a href="surface.html">molecular surfaces</a>,
with default coloring
ranging from <b>red</b> for negative potential through <b>white</b> 
to <b>blue</b> for positive potential
<a href="../tools/moldisplay.html" title="Molecule Display Toolbar...">
<img class="icon" border=1 src="../tools/shortcut-icons/esp.png"></a>.
If the surfaces do not already exist, they will be generated.
The calculation can handle structures with or without 
explicit <a href="#hydrogens">hydrogens</a>.
The <a href="#charges">atomic charges</a> are looked up for standard residues,
and in the rarer case they are needed for nonstandard residues, calculated 
by <a href="https://ambermd.org/antechamber/antechamber.html"
target="_blank"><b>Antechamber</b></a>
according to the <b>chargeMethod</b> option (default <b>am1-bcc</b>).
However, before the charge assignment, certain modified nucleic acid residues 
will be mutated automatically to their unmodified counterparts as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>bromo-UMP (5BU) to UMP (U)</b> &ndash;
5-bromouridine-5'-monophosphate (PDB chemical component
<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/5BU" target="_blank">5BU</a>)
to RNA residue uridine-5'-monophosphate (U)
by deleting the bromine atom
<li> <b>methylselenyl-dUMP (UMS) to UMP (U)</b> &ndash;
2'-methylselenyl-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (PDB chemical component
<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/UMS" target="_blank">UMS</a>)
to RNA residue uridine-5'-monophosphate (U)
by replacing the methylselenyl moiety with an oxygen atom named O2'
and adjusting the bond length to 1.430 &Aring;
<li> <b>methylselenyl-dCMP (CSL) to CMP (C)</b> &ndash;
2'-methylselenyl-2'-deoxycytidine-5'-phosphate (PDB chemical component
<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/CSL" target="_blank">CSL</a>)
to RNA residue cytidine-5'-monophosphate (C)
by replacing the methylselenyl moiety with an oxygen atom named O2'
and adjusting the bond length to 1.430 &Aring;
</ul>
<p>
Selenomethionine residues (MSE) are simply assigned the charges for the 
standard residue methionine (MET) without being mutated.

</p><p>
Coulombic electrostatic potential is calculated from atomic partial charges 
and coordinates according to Coulomb's law:
</p>
<blockquote>
<font size ="+1">
&phi; = &Sigma; [q<sub>i</sub> / (&epsilon;d<sub>i</sub>)]
</font>
</blockquote>
&phi; is the potential (which varies in space),
q are the atomic partial charges,
d are the distances from the atoms, and
&epsilon; is the dielectric, representing screening by the medium.
The resulting potential is in units of kcal/(mol&middot;<i>e</i>) at 298 K.
</p><p>
A distance-dependent dielectric is sometimes used to approximate screening
by implicit solvent. By default,
<b>distDep true</b> and <b>dielectric 4.0</b> are used:
<blockquote>
<font size ="+1">
&epsilon; = 4d
</font>
</blockquote>
With <b>distDep false</b>, &epsilon; is a constant <i>C</i>
given with the <b>dielectric</b> option.
</p><p>
The <a name="offset"><b>offset</b></a> <i>d</i> is how far out
from each surface vertex, along its normal, to evaluate the data.
The default of <b>1.4</b> &Aring; is typically used for coloring a
<a href="surface.html">molecular surface</a> by electrostatic potential.
The rationale for looking outward is that the values at the centers
of any interacting atoms are more relevant than those at their surfaces.
By default, a <a href="surface.html#surfdefs">molecular surface</a>
shows where the surface of a spherical probe
of radius 1.4 &Aring; can lie, the
<a href="surface.html#surfdefs">solvent-excluded surface</a>.
An offset of 1.4 &Aring; approximates the
<a href="surface.html#surfdefs">solvent-accessible surface</a>,
about as close as the probe center can get to the molecule.
** However, an offset of 0.0 may be preferred for coloring
<a href="surface.html#cap">surface caps</a>
(from <a href="clip.html">clipping</a>),
and a zero or negative offset may be appropriate
for coloring the surface of one structure by the potential from another. **
</p><p>
<a name="palette-options"></a>
The default <a href="color.html#palette-options"><i>palette-options</i></a> 
for coloring are <table border cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle"><tr>
<td bgcolor=red width="10px" title="red"></td>
<td bgcolor=white width="10px" title="white"></td>
<td bgcolor=blue width="10px" title="blue"></td>
</tr></table>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b><a href="color.html#palette">palette</a> red-white-blue 
&nbsp;<a href="color.html#range">range</a> -10,10</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
When <b>coulombic</b> is run interactively (in gui mode and not via a
<a href="usageconventions.html#cxc-files">script</a>),
the <b>key true</b> option can be used to
start <a href="../tools/colorkey.html"><b>Color Key</b></a>
and draw a color key with the corresponding colors and values.
</p><p>
By default,
a <a href="surface.html">molecular surface</a> is generated as needed
for each biopolymer chain that contains any of the specified atoms,
colored by the Coulombic ESP from <i>all</i> of the atoms enclosed by that
surface, and the surface patches for the specified atoms are displayed.
An independent calculation is performed for each surface, using only the charges
from the atoms enclosed by that surface. Typically, each biopolymer chain
has its own molecular surface that does not include ligand or solvent.
</p><p>
Alternatively, one or more pre-existing 
<a href="surface.html">molecular surfaces</a>
can be specified with the <b>surfaces</b> option,
in which case the calculation will use the charges of the
specified atoms only.
The only way to use different atoms than enclosed by a surface
to calculate the ESP for coloring that surface is to
use both a non-blank <a href="atomspec.html"><i>atom-spec</i></a>
and the <b>surfaces</b> option. In that case, care is needed to specify only 
the intended set of atoms (see <a href="#charges">atomic charges</a>, below).
</p>

<a name="hydrogens"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: coulombic</a>]
</p>
<h3>Hydrogens</h3>
<p>
The calculation requires charge assignments, which in turn require hydrogens.
However, an existing structure lacking hydrogens is not changed;
a copy is created in memory, <a href="addh.html">protonated</a>,
and assigned charges from a lookup table. 
</p><p>
The <b>hisScheme</b> option indicates how to (implicitly) protonate
residues named HIS in structures without hydrogens:
</p>
<ul>
<li>HID
&ndash; neutral sidechain, implicitly protonated at &delta;-nitrogen
<li>HIE
&ndash; neutral sidechain, implicitly protonated at &epsilon;-nitrogen
<li>HIP
&ndash; positive sidechain, implicitly protonated at both sidechain nitrogens
</ul>
<p>
If <b>hisScheme</b> is not specified, the protonation state of each HIS
residue will be chosen based on the local H-bonding environment.
The option applies only to residues named HIS. Regardless of this option,
histidines that already have the special names (HID, HIE, HIP) 
will be protonated accordingly.
</p>

<a name="charges"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: coulombic</a>]
</p>
<h3>Atomic Charges</h3>
<p>
Currently there is no choice of different charge sets for standard residues.
These charge values are taken from the following files in
<a href="https://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php" target="_blank">AmberTools20</a>:
all_amino03.in, amino12.in, nucleic10.in, aminont12.in, and aminoct12.in.
These include standard amino acid and nucleic acid residues,
MSE (selenomethionine), HOH (water),
ACE, NH2, NME (peptide-capping residues),
ADP, ATP, GDP, GTP, NDP, and NAD (common cofactors).
</p><p>
The presence of any other residues within the biopolymer surface
will trigger a charge calculation with
<a href="https://ambermd.org/antechamber/antechamber.html"
target="_blank"><b>Antechamber</b></a>
according to the <b>chargeMethod</b> option (default <b>am1-bcc</b>).
Solvent, ligands, ions, and cofactors are normally
not enclosed by <a href="surface.html">molecular surfaces</a>,
so this situation should be relatively rare.
</p><p>
When the <b>surfaces</b> option is used, however,
the calculation is not automatically
limited to the atoms enclosed by those surfaces.
Thus, care is required to specify only
the atoms desired for the calculation, so that ligands, solvent, <i>etc.</i>
are not accidentally included and no unnecessary charge calculations are
performed. The <a href="atomspec.html#builtin"><b>protein</b></a>
specifier is often useful for this purpose,
and can be restricted further by other specifiers such as
model ID and chain number:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>coulombic protein surfaces #2</b>
<br>
<b>coulombic #1/A & protein surfaces #2</b>
</blockquote>

<!--
<a name="map"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: coulombic</a>]
</p>
<h3>ESP Maps</h3>
<p>
With <b>map true</b> (default <b>false</b>), 
each ESP map will be opened a volume model.
This allows <a href="save.html#map">saving the map</a> to a file and/or
subsequently coloring surfaces by the map values using 
<a href="color.html#map"><b>color electrostatic</b></a>
without having to recalculate the map on the fly.
</p><p>
The <b>spacing</b> <i>s</i> of the map grid can be
specified in the range 0.1&ndash;10.0 &Aring; (default <b>1.0</b>).
Decreasing the spacing increases map size and calculation time.
</p><p>
The <b>padding</b> <i>p</i> is how far the map grid should extend beyond
the atoms in every direction (default <b>5.0</b> &Aring;).
