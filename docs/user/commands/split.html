<h3><a href="../index.html#commands">Command</a>: split</h3>
<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
<br><b>split</b>
&nbsp;<a href="atomspec.html#hierarchy"><i>model-spec</i></a>&nbsp;
[&nbsp;<b>chains</b>&nbsp;]
[&nbsp;<b>ligands</b>&nbsp;]
[&nbsp;<b>connected</b>&nbsp;]
[&nbsp;<b>atoms</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="atomspec.html"><i>atom-spec</i></a>&nbsp;]<sub><i>n</i></sub>
</h3>

<p>
The <b>split</b> command partitions atomic models into separate submodels
in the <a href="atomspec.html#hierarchy">hierarchy</a>.
For example, model #1 could be split into #1.1, #1.2, <i>etc.</i> 
Splitting parts of a model into separate submodels may facilitate their
independent control, such as with <b>Model Panel</b> checkboxes
or <a href="mousemode.html">mouse modes</a> that act on whole models.
</p><p>
As per the usual convention, a blank specification means &ldquo;all.&rdquo;
That is, if no models are specified, all atomic models will be affected.
There is no way to undo this operation except by reopening
the original data.
</p><p>
How to split can be indicated with one or more of the following:
<ul>
<li><b>chains</b> - by chain ID (default)
<li><b>ligands</b> - each
<a href="atomspec.html#builtin">ligand</a> in a separate submodel,
the remaining atoms in another
<li><b>connected</b> - into covalently bonded sets of atoms
<li><b>atoms</b> &nbsp;<a href="atomspec.html"><i>atom-spec</i></a>&nbsp;
- can be used multiple times in the same command, for example:
<blockquote>
<b>split #1 atoms :1-100 atoms :101-150 atoms :151-200</b>
</blockquote>
... to place each set of specified atoms, 
as well as the set of unspecified atoms, in a separate submodel.
</ul>
If none of the above are given, the <b>chains</b> method will be used.
If there is nothing to split, the original model will be left unaltered.
