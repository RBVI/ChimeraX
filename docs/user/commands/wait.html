<h3><a href="../index.html#commands">Command</a>: wait</h3>
<h3 class="usage"><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
<br><b>wait</b> [&nbsp;<i>wait-frames</i>&nbsp;]</h3>
<p>
The <b>wait</b> command updates the display for a specified number of 
<i>wait-frames</i> before allowing execution of the next command in a script.
It can also be used to generate duplicate image frames in movies
(like <a href="movie.html#duplicate"><b>movie duplicate</b></a>).

<h4>Ordered Command Execution</h4>
<p>
Following certain multi-frame commands,
<b>wait</b> without a number will automatically wait the needed number 
of frames for the command to finish:
<a href="move.html"><b>move</b></a>,
<a href="turn.html"><b>turn</b></a>,
<a href="rock.html"><b>rock</b></a>,
<a href="roll.html"><b>roll</b></a>,
<a href="zoom.html"><b>zoom</b></a>,
<a href="2dlabels.html"><b>2dlabels</b></a>,
<a href="view.html"><b>view</b></a>,
and <a href="fly.html"><b>fly</b></a>.
Other commands require the number to be given explicitly.
In the following example, <b>wait</b> prevents 
<a href="move.html"><b>move</b></a>
from starting until <a href="roll.html"><b>roll</b></a> has finished:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b><a href="roll.html">roll</a> y 3 120</b>
<br><b>wait</b>
<br><b><a href="move.html">move</a> x 0.2 75</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is also acceptable to give the frame argument where it could have been
omitted (in the example, <b>wait 120</b> instead of just <b>wait</b>).
</p><p>
Unlike Chimera, when executing a command file,
ChimeraX does not add an implicit <b>wait 1</b> at the end of each line
that could change the display.
Thus, after a series of commands is saved
from the <a href="../tools/cli.html#history"><b>Command History</b></a> 
or otherwise written to a text file to create a 
<a href="open.html#local">ChimeraX command script</a>,
it may be necessary to add <b>wait</b> or
<b>wait <i>N</i></b> commands between them 
(or appended to lines with a semicolon separator)
to see the effects of individual commands as they are executed and/or
enforce their ordered execution.
</p>

<h4>Duplicate Image Frames in Movies</h4>
<p>
Stretches of duplicate image frames correspond to periods of time
where objects remain static. If motion occurs in the last few frames 
of a movie, due to the encoding process it may appear to end on a blur.
This effect can be avoided by including a few wait frames 
(<b>wait 5</b> or similar) at the end of scripted movie content.
