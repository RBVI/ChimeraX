<h3><a href="../index.html#commands">Command</a>: fly</h3>
<h3 class="usage"><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
<br><b>fly</b> 
[&nbsp;<i>master-frames</i>&nbsp;] &nbsp;<i>pos1</i>&nbsp;
[[&nbsp;<i>frames1_2</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>pos2</i>]
[[&nbsp;<i>frames2_3</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>pos3</i>] ...

<b>Fly</b> uses cubic interpolation to smoothly traverse a series of views
previously named and saved with <a href="view.html#name"><b>view name</b></a>.
<!-- does not interpolate clipping plane positions, 
field of view, camera stereo parameters -->
The <a href="view.html#name"><b>view</b></a></b> command can also interpolate
between views, but it only considers a pair of views
(start and end) at a time, whereas
<b>fly</b> can consider multiple views and generate a path that
visits and leaves intermediate views without discontinuities in motion.

<b>Fly</b> starts abruptly at the first view, <i>pos1</i>,
then proceeds through the list of subsequent views.
Besides views previously saved with
<a href="view.html#name"><b>view name</b></a>,
the current view can be indicated with the name <b>start</b>.
(Using the name <b>start</b> in the <b>fly</b> command
also saves the view; it could be restored later with
<a href="view.html#name"><b>view</b></a>.)
The <i>master-frames</i> argument (default <b>100</b>)
is how many frames each &ldquo;leg&rdquo; of the journey 
(from one view to the next) should take, 
unless overridden by a frames argument specific to that leg.
</p><p>
<a name="examples">Examples</a>:
<blockquote><b>
fly 20 start p1
</b></blockquote>
&ndash; go from the current view to p1 in 20 frames
<blockquote><b>
fly p1 p2 p3
</b></blockquote>
&ndash; go from p1 to p2 in 1 frame and then to p3 in 1 frame
<blockquote><b>
fly 50 p1 p2 p3
</b></blockquote>
&ndash; go from p1 to p2 in 50 frames and then to p3 in 50 frames
<blockquote><b>
fly p1 10 p2 25 p3
</b></blockquote>
&ndash; go from p1 to p2 in 10 frames and then to p3 in 25 frames
<blockquote><b>
fly 40 p1 100 p2 p3
</b></blockquote>
&ndash; go from p1 to p2 in 100 frames and then to p3 in 40 frames
