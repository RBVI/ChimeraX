<h3><a href="../index.html#commands">Command</a>: meeting</h3>

<p>
The <b>meeting</b> command shares a scene between
two or more ChimeraX instances running on different computers.
Options for starting and joining a meeting are also implemented 
in a <a href="../tools/meeting.html"><b>Meeting</b></a>
graphical interface that is simpler to use than the command.
<b>Meeting</b> allows conducting a multi-person
<a href="../vr.html">virtual reality</a> (VR) session in ChimeraX.
It can also be used without VR, but in that case, 
a desktop screen-sharing program may be a more reliable alternative.
Each participant is represented by a head-position image and 
hand-controller pointer cones
so that participants can see each other pointing at objects in the scene.
For non-VR participants, the camera view is synchronized, and
the cone indicating the mouse pointer position of a non-VR user
is displayed to others when the user pauses the mouse over a model,
as for picking. 
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>meeting start nanobody</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; start a meeting named <i>nanobody</i><br>
<b>meeting join nanobody</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; join a meeting named <i>nanobody</i><br>
<b>meeting close</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; leave the current meeting
</blockquote>

<p>
Aside from synchronizing pointers, the <b>meeting</b> command will 
<a href="#copyScene">copy</a>
a session from the ChimeraX instance that initiates the meeting 
to each person who joins the meeting.
This copying is done only when a person joins the meeting. 
Commands executed by one participant will automatically execute for the others
(by <a href="#relayCommands">default</a>),
and if a participant using VR moves the scene,
others using VR will see the motion.
Participants not using VR have a synchronized common viewing direction
that is not related to the viewing direction of VR participants.
</p>

<p>
The <b>meeting</b> command is under development 
and has several <a href="#limitations">limitations</a>.

<b>Compatibility</b>: The message protocol used by the meeting command changed in a non-backward
compatible way in ChimeraX versions released after December 8, 2020.  All
participants of a meeting must use a ChimeraX version newer than that date,
or all must use a version older than that date.  The incompatible change
enabled reducing the network bandwidth (4-10x reduction) and
increasing security that prevents joining a meeting without knowing its name.

</blockquote>
<p>
A meeting is initiated with
<b>meeting start</b> <i>meeting-name</i>,
where the meeting name is a text identifier that participants will
use to join the meeting. Meeting names are not case-sensitive.
The initiator (and each person who <a href="#join">joins</a>)
can specify a <b>name</b> for identification within the shared 
environment, a pointer-cone <b>color</b>, and a <b>faceImage</b> file.
These three settings are remembered
whenever they are specified, and the remembered settings can be reported or 
changed with the <a href="#settings"><b>meeting settings</b></a> command.
Full list of options:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a name="name"></a>
<b>name</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>participant-name</i>
<br>
Name to show for a participant's pointer and image models

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a name="color"></a>  
<b>color</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="colornames.html"><i>pointer-color</i></a>
<br>
Color for the cones representing a VR participant's hand-controller pointers
(or non-VR participant's mouse pointer).
The pointer color is remembered as a
<a href="../preferences.html#other">preference</a>
(initial default <b>lime</b>
<table border cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"

The server determines how participants connect to a meeting and is used
to get around firewalls that block access. The initial default method
<b>chimeraxmeeting.net</b> has participants connect to a public server
that forwards connections to the computer that started the meeting.
The method <b>direct</b> has partipants directly connect to the
computer that started the meeting but will fail if that computer
cannot be reached. Additional methods can be defined using the 
<a href="#server"><b>meeting server</b></a> command.
Using this option with <b>meeting start</b> or <b>meeting settings</b>
sets the method as the user default in the

<p>
Participants join the meeting by specifying its name.
If a meeting is started without a <i>meeting-name</i>,
participants join it by specifying the host name or IP address
(<i>e.g.</i>, <b>descartes.cgl.ucsf.edu</b> or <b>169.230.21.39</b>)
reported in the <a href="../tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a> by the
<a href="#start"><b>meeting start</b></a> command.
A participant's <b>name</b>, pointer-cone <b>color</b>, and <b>faceImage</b> 
settings are remembered whenever they are specified,
and the remembered settings can be reported or changed with the 
<a href="#settings"><b>meeting settings</b></a> command.

<blockquote>
<b>host</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>host-name</i>
<br>
The first argument of the <b>meeting</b> command normally specifies either a 
meeting name or a host name.
Names containing &ldquo;.&rdquo; or &ldquo;:&rdquo;
are interpreted as a host name.
To avoid ambiguity, that first argument can be omitted, and the <b>host</b>
option used instead to ensure interpreting the value as a host name
(<i>e.g.</i>, <b>descartes.cgl.ucsf.edu</b> or <b>169.230.21.39</b>).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>port</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>N</i>
<br>
If participants join a meeting using a host name or IP address instead of a 
meeting name, they will need to specify the port on the destination computer,
unless it is the default port, <b>52194</b>.
If a meeting name is used to join a meeting, this option is not used, 
as the port will be looked up using the meeting name. 
</blockquote>

<h3>Naming New Meeting Servers</h3>
<blockquote>

<b>meeting server</b> [&nbsp;<i>server-name</i>&nbsp;]
[&nbsp;<a href="#address"><b>address</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>host</i>&nbsp;]

[&nbsp;<a href="#serverTimeout"><b>timeout</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>seconds</i>&nbsp;]
[&nbsp;<a href="#serverDelete"><b>delete</b></a>&nbsp;]
</blockquote>
<p>
Example command that defines a name for a new server with given IP address, user account and password file:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>meeting server</b> "NIAID meeting server" <b>address</b> 52.0.161.5 <b>account</b> chimerax <b>key</b> /Users/goddard/ucsf/aws/niaid-chimerax-user.pem
</blockquote>
<p>
The <b>meeting server</b> command defines a name for a new server
that is shorthand for a computer address, 
a port number or port range, an authentication key, and a timeout value.
When starting a meeting the server to use can be specified
with the <a href="#start"><b>meeting start</b></a>
command <a href="#serveropt"><b>server</b></a> option.
Server names with their settings are remembered as 
<a href="../preferences.html#other">preferences</a>.
Given without arguments, <b>meeting server</b> reports the existing 
server names in the <a href="../tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
To configure a computer to be a server, 
see the <a href="#setupserver">instructions</a> below.
</p>

<blockquote>
<a name="address"></a>
<b>address</b> &nbsp;<i>host-address</i>
<br>
Host name or IP address of a publicly visible server computer to forward 
connections made by partipants to the computer that started the meeting.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a name="serverPort"></a>
<b>port</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>N</i>
<br>
The port number on the server computer that participants connect to 
(initial default <b>52194</b>).
One port is used for receiving connections from all participants.
If a tunnel is created because the <b>account</b> option has been specified,
then this port is not used and instead an available port in <b>portRange</b>
is used. A tunnel is not needed for port forwarding from a 
network-address-translation router to a computer on the local network
served by the router.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a name="account"></a>
<b>account</b> &nbsp;<i>username</i>
<br>
A user name of an account on the server computer for creating an ssh tunnel.
Specifying this option implies that an ssh tunnel will be created between
the computer that starts the meeting and the server computer.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a name="key"></a>
<b>key</b> &nbsp;<i>ssh-identity-file</i>
<br>
The ssh identity file (<i>e.g.</i>, <b>meeting-key-private.pem</b>)
for the account on the server computer used to make an ssh tunnel.
Substituting the word <a href="usageconventions.html#browse"><b>browse</b></a>
for the pathname brings up a file browser window for choosing the
file interactively.
This identity file is the private key used to connect to the server using
the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh <i>-i</i></a>
option when creating the tunnel. The file must not
have read permissions by others or ssh will consider it insecure and 
not accept it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a name="portRange"></a>
<b>portRange</b> &nbsp;<i>port-min,port-max</i>
<br>
The range of port numbers to use on the server computer.
A randomly chosen port in this range is chosen to create a tunnel.
All participants connect to that port.
The initial default range of <b>52194,52203</b> 
allows up 10 simultaneous meetings to be handled by the server.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a name="serverTimeout"></a>
<b>timeout</b> &nbsp;<i>seconds</i>
<br>
The time to wait for creating the tunnel to the server.
If a connection is not made within this time the meeting will not be started.
The initial default is <b>5</b> seconds.
</blockquote>

</p>
<h3>Leaving a Meeting</h3>
<blockquote>
<a href="usageconventions.html"><b>Usage</b></a>:

<h3>Sharing a Scene</h3>
<blockquote>
<a href="usageconventions.html"><b>Usage</b></a>:
<b>meeting</b> &nbsp;<b>send</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
If unshared changes have been made, a participant can share 
his current scene with the others by using <b>meeting send</b>.
This replaces the entire scene for the other participants and
may take significant time to transmit to the participants if
the scene contains large data models.

<h3>Reporting Meeting Status</h3>
<blockquote>

<h3>Removing an Unused Meeting Name</h3>
<blockquote>
<a href="usageconventions.html"><b>Usage</b></a>:
<b>meeting</b> &nbsp;<b>unname</b> &nbsp;<i>meeting-name</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the computer that started a meeting loses its network connection
before the meeting is closed, the meeting name will not be removed 
from the name server, and future
attempts to use the same meeting name will fail, saying the meeting
name is already being used. To remove the meeting name from the
name server, use <b>meeting unname</b> <i>meeting-name</i>.
</p>

<a name="limitations"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: meeting</a>]
</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>
<b>Firewalls block connections.</b>
Most organizations have firewalls that block incoming network 
connections, and require administrative requests to open up network ports.
The <a href="#serveropt"><b>server</b></a> option allows participants to connect
to a publicly visible server computer.
See <a href="#firewalls">getting around firewalls</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>No passwords.</b>
There is no support for passwords to limit access to meetings.
Any person who knows the meeting name can join the meeting.  The
<a href="#nameServer">meeting name server</a>
provides no way to list meeting names, so only
participants who are told the meeting name will be able to join.
In this sense the meeting name serves as the password, and using a less
common name will prevent others guessing or accidentally joining the 
wrong meeting. To join a meeting the participant's Chimera transmits
the meeting name to the host.  The connection will be rejected if the name
is incorrect preventing uninvited users from connecting and preventing
port scans from generating spurious connections.
</p>

<p>
<b>Synchronizing changes.</b>
After the initial scene is shared changes made by one participant will
be propagated to other participants. Changes that are propagated include 
moving and scaling the displayed structures and
(by <a href="#relayCommands">default</a>) 
executing <a href="../index.html#commands">commands</a>.
If a participant makes any unshared changes or
introduces data for which the input file is not directly accessible 
to others (<i>i.e.</i>, the same <a href="open.html"><b>open</b></a>
command will not work for everyone), <b>meeting send</b> 
is needed to share the updated session.
This may be slow for large amounts of data.
</p>

<p>
<b>Small number of participants.</b>
The meeting command has been used for two to four participants.
The number of participants is not limited.
Larger numbers of participants increase the network bandwidth needed
expecially for the computer hosting the meeting and may result in
slow or jittery updating.  All data to synchronize the scene is
transmitted through the computer that starts the meeting, so it is a bottleneck.
Each VR participant sends about 40 Kbits/second to update hand and head
position.  Desktop participants do not send continuous messages, only sending
when they move the models or execute commands.
</p>

<p>
<b>No audio chat support.</b>
An audio connection is not provided,
so it is necessary to set up a separate audio link for remote participants.
<a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a> using the VR headset speakers and microphone
works well.
</p>

<p>
<b>Aligning two VR headsets in one room.</b>
Two Vive or Vive Pro VR headsets can be used in the same room, each connected
to its own computer. Each headset uses the same pair of base stations.
A problem sometimes arises that the two headsets do not see the 
ChimeraX structures displayed at the same location in the room.
Specifically, one headset may see the structure positions 
as if the room is rotated 180&deg; relative to the other headset.
This happens because the SteamVR room setup is run separately on each computer
and produces a different coordinate system. For structures to have the same
room position in both headsets, the room boundaries traced using SteamVR room
setup should be the same for both computers. The first step of SteamVR room
setup in which users are asked to point the hand controller at the screen 
and click is the key to avoiding 180&deg; misorientation. At that step, it
is important to point along the short axis of the 
rectangle defining the room bounds (that will be traced in a later step).
SteamVR chooses between two coordinate system orientations
rotated 180&deg; from each other based on the direction of pointing.
If pointing is along the long axis of the rectangle bounds, a slight tilt 
toward the left or right of the long axis produces opposite coordinate 
system orientations. Pointing along the short axis instead is a reliable
way to make both computers use the same orientation.
(The computer screen position is irrelevant.)

[<a href="#top">back to top: meeting</a>]
</p>
<h3>Getting Around Firewalls</h3>
<p>
Most universities, colleges, institutions, companies and government labs 
have firewalls that prevent incoming network connections.
When joining a meeting that is not using a server, 
ChimeraX attempts to connect
to port 52194 on the computer that started the meeting, and shows a status
message &ldquo;Waiting for scene data from meeting host.&rdquo;
If the connection is blocked, after 5 seconds 
(<a href="#timeout">default</a>) an error message will appear:
</p>
<pre style="color:red">
  Socket error Connection timed out
</pre>
<p>
Two ways to resolve the problem are to:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#useserver">Use a server computer</a> outside the firewall;
participants connect to the server machine and it forwards
connections through the firewall to the computer that started the meeting.
This is enabled with the <a href="#serveropt"><b>server</b></a> option
of the <b>meeting start</b> command, specifying a server
such as chimeraxmeeting.net (the default).
<br>&ndash; OR &ndash;<br>
<li><a href="#openport">Open a port in the firewall</a> that protects the computer 
that started the meeting to allow incoming connections.
</ul>
<p>
Details on each approach are given below.
</p>

<a name="useserver"></a>
<h4><a href="#firewalls" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
Use a server</h4>

<p>
By default the meeting start command uses a publicly visible server computer
chimeraxmeeting.net
which forwards connections through the firewall to the host computer.
This is controlled by the 
<a href="#serveropt"><b>server</b></a> option, for example
<b>meeting start alzheimers server chimeraxmeeting.net</b>.
The chimeraxmeeting.net server is provided by the ChimeraX development
team and can handle up to 10 simultaneous meetings.
</p>

<p>
Several problems may arise. The server may be at capacity,
may be out of service, may introduce delays of seconds if participants
are in distant parts of the world from the default server in California, USA.

<h4>Setting up one's own server</h4>
  
<p>
These problems can be mitigated by setting up and using one's own server,
for example, using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The AWS machine simply accepts
connections and forwards them to the host computer behind the 
institution firewall using an ssh tunnel.
</p><p>
Here is how to set up a server using an AWS virtual machine for ChimeraX meetings.
This could be done with any cloud virtual machine service since only ssh is required.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an AWS EC2 virtual machine; I used a free tier type t2.micro 
using an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Amazon Machine Image.
The machine will need minimal compute as it is just forwarding data.
The network bandwidth needed depends on the number of participants, which
each VR participant sending about 40 Kbits/second of hand and head position
information.  The only large data being forwarded is the initial 
ChimeraX meeting session. I chose Ubuntu 18.04 only because I have experience 
with it. Any Linux distribution will work, since only ssh will be used.
  <li>Set the virtual machine security group to allow any computer to connect
on ports 52194 - 52203. By default, the virtual machine will not allow connections 
except on ssh port 22, so this is a necessary step.
  <li>Change sshd configuration file on the virtual machine 
/etc/ssh/sshd_config enabling &ldquo;GatewayPorts yes&rdquo;
and restart sshd (on Ubuntu 18, &ldquo;sudo service ssh restart&rdquo;).
This will allow other computers to connect to ssh tunnels.
The normal use of ssh remote tunnels allows only the remote computer to use the tunnel,
so this setting change is necessary.
  <li>Create an server name for the server using the 
<a href="#server"><b>meeting server</b></a> command
<blockquote>
  <b>meeting server</b> myserver <b>address</b> 54.215.157.17 <b>account</b> ubuntu <b>key</b> meeting-key-private.pem
</blockquote>
The <a href="#key"><b>key</b></a> option specifies
the public key encryption file <b>meeting-key-private.pem</b>
that was made when I created the AWS virtual machine. 
It allows ssh access to the virtual machine without typing a password. 
The &ldquo;ubuntu&rdquo; is the default administer account name on the AWS virtual machine.
To use this to start a meeting
<blockquote>
  <b>meeting start</b> antibody309 <b>server</b> myserver
</blockquote>
The meeting start command will create the tunnel using ssh by executing a command like
<pre>
      ssh -N -i meeting-key-private.pem -R 52201:localhost:52194 ubuntu@54.215.157.17
</pre>
The server option used to start the meeting will be remembered
as a preference so those need only be used one time.  Subsequent meetings can
specify only the meeting name.
Connections through the tunnel appear to come from the host machine.
  <li>When participants join the meeting using command <b>meet antibody309</b>
it will connect to the AWS virtual machine public IP address.
The participants do not need any authentication or account on the 
AWS virtual machine. If there are participants within the same firewall 
as the meeting host, they can connect directly to the host computer 
without using the AWS virtual machine (for example, command:
<b>meet 169.230.21.34</b>). Connections through the tunnel and from 
within the firewall can both be made in the same meeting.
  <li>In the above configuration the AWS administration account 
&ldquo;ubuntu&rdquo; was used.
For better security it is worth making a separate account on the virtual machine
to create the tunnels.  This is especially important if the private key
will be shared to allow different people to initiate meetings using this server.
The account can have no login shell to prevent using ssh to execute commands,
only allowing tunnels to be created. On Ubuntu,
an account named &ldquo;tunnel&rdquo;
can be made with the following commands starting from the ubuntu admin account.
<pre>
  sudo adduser tunnel --disabled-password
  sudo su - tunnel
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -C "ChimeraX meeting server" -f tunnel-key.pem
  mkdir .ssh
  chmod go-rwx .ssh
  mv tunnel-key.pem.pub .ssh/authorized_keys
  # Move tunnel-key.pem (private key) to machine that will start meetings.
  exit
  sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin tunnel
</pre>
To define a new server name using this safer tunnel account:
<blockquote>
  <b>meeting server</b> myserver <b>address</b> 54.215.157.17 <b>account</b> tunnel <b>key</b> meeting-key-private.pem
</blockquote>
The server option used previously will be remembered so this server will be used when starting a meeting
<blockquote>
  <b>meeting start antibody442</b>
</blockquote>

<h4><a href="#firewalls" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
Open a firewall port</h4>
<p>
A less complex solution than a server is to change the firewall settings protecting
the computer that starts the meeting to allow incoming connections 
on port 52194. Here are two examples of how that can be done:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Home network firewall.</b>
If the meeting host is on a home network, a port forwarding rule can be 
added using the home router administration interface.
A home usually has just one internet address visible from the outside,
and a router that
connects all the home devices (computers, phones, tablets, TVs...)
on an internal network.
To allow outside meeting participants to reach the computer on 
the home network:
<ol>
<li>Assign the host computer a static IP address on the home network
(<i>e.g.</i>, 192.168.0.2) &ndash; this is
sometimes called a &ldquo;static lease&rdquo;
<li>Set a port forwarding rule to forward port 52194 to that address
<li>Define an server name that has participants connect to the router IP address
and use it when starting a meeting, for example,
<blockquote>
  <b>meeting server</b> natrouter <b>address</b> 188.15.37.68 <b>port</b> 52194<br>
  <b>meeting start</b> rotavirus <b>server</b> natrouter
</blockquote>
  
</ol>

<li><b>Institution firewall.</b>
If the computer is behind an institution firewall, it may be possible 
to ask the institution to open the port. For example, 
at the University of California San Francisco, I (Tom Goddard) put in a request
with the Information Technology department to open port 52194
on the campus firewall for connections to my desktop PC.
They opened the port just for this one computer, limiting the security threats. 
It took about 10 days before they processed the request. Use the "direct" server
to start a meeting:
<blockquote>
  <b>meeting start</b> influenza <b>server</b> direct
</blockquote>
Some institutions
will not allow these exceptions due to institution security requirements.
</ul>

<h3>Setting up a Private Name Server</h3>
<p>
By default, the meeting command uses the name server <b>chimeraxmeeting.net</b>
to record the computer address and port number for each active meeting name.
This conveniently allows participants to join a meeting with a simple command,
<b>meeting</b> <i>meeting-name</i>.
The name server does not log the meetings, and there is no capability 
to list the meeting names or computers addresses and ports, providing 
privacy and security. In order to identify a meeting, a request would 
need to guess the meeting name.
</p><p>
For greater security, an organization may wish to use its own meeting-name
server.  This can be done by running shell command
<b>nohup python3 namerserver.py start &</b> on a machine
accessible to the participants. The nohup allows exiting the shell 
while leaving the name server running. 
The nameserver.py file is included in the ChimeraX distribution under 
Chimerax/lib/python3.8/site-packages/chimerax/meeting/nameserver.py (on Linux).
To use the name server, all participants specify the name server address using 
the <a href="#nameServer"><b>nameServer</b></a> option when joining the meeting
or before joining with the <b>meeting settings</b> command.
This option value is remembered, so only needs to be used once to enable 
use of the private name server for future meetings.

<h3>Future Developments</h3>

<p>
<b>Large meetings</b>.
We have not tried meetings with more than four participants. 
In principle, meetings can have any number of participants,
but this needs testing and likely some improvements
to make larger meetings feasible. Probably would need the ability 
for the host to prevent participants from moving or changing the models.
</p>

<p>
<b>Reuse large data files</b>.
It would be useful if large data files could be transferred just one time 
and then used for multiple meetings. Currently all data is transferred 
at the start of each meeting, which can be time-consuming.
