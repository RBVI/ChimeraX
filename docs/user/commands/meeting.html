The <b>meeting</b> command shares a scene between
two or more ChimeraX instances running on different computers.
Its main purpose is to allow multi-person
<a href="../vr.html">virtual reality</a> (VR) sessions in ChimeraX, 
although it can also be used without VR. 
Each participant is represented by a head image and 
hand-controller pointers (or if not using VR, the mouse pointer)
so that participants can see each other pointing at atoms in the scene.
See also: <a href="vr.html"><b>vr</b></a>
</p><p>
The meeting is initiated with <b>meeting start</b>, which reports the 
hostname and IP address in the <a href="../tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
Subsequently, others join using <b>meeting</b> <i>host</i>,
where <i>host</i> is the hostname or IP address of the starting instance
(<i>e.g.</i>, <b>descartes.cgl.ucsf.edu</b> or <b>169.230.21.39</b>).
</p><p>
Each participant can specify a <b>name</b> to serve as an identifier 
within the shared environment, a <b>headImage</b> file, 
and a pointer-cone <b>color</b>.
</p><p>
Aside from synchronizing pointers, the <b>meeting</b> command will 
<a href="#options">copy</a>
a session from the ChimeraX instance that initiates the meeting 
to each person who joins the meeting.
This copying is done only when a person joins the meeting. 
Commands executed by one participant will automatically execute for the others
(by <a href="#relayCommands">default</a>),
and if a participant using VR moves the scene,
others using VR will see the motion.
Participants not using VR maintain their own viewing directions.
If unshared changes have been made, a participant can still share 
his current scene with the others by using <b>meeting send</b>.
The host can end the meeting with <b>meeting close</b>, or
others can use it to exit the meeting individually.
</p><p>
The <b>meeting</b> command is under development 
and has several <a href="#limitations">limitations</a>.

<h3>Options</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>name</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>participant-name</i>
<br>
Name to show for a participant's pointer and head-image models
in the <a href="../tools/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>color</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="colornames.html"><i>pointer-color</i></a>
<br>
Color for the cones representing a VR participant's hand-controller pointers
(or non-VR participant's mouse pointer).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>headImage</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>image-file</i>
<br>
Image to represent a VR participant's headset position,
where <i>image-file</i> is the pathname of a JPG or PNG file.
The pathname can be absolute or relative to the current working directory as
reported by <a href="pwd.html"><b>pwd</b></a>,
Substituting the word <a href="usageconventions.html#browse"><b>browse</b></a>
for the pathname brings up a file browser window for choosing the
file interactively.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>copyScene</b> &nbsp;<b>true</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false
<br>
Specified with <b>meeting start</b>,
whether to copy the session from the starting instance
to each person who joins the meeting (default <b>true</b>).
This copying is done only when a person joins the meeting. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a name="relayCommands"></a>
<b>relayCommands</b> &nbsp;<b>true</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false
<br>
Whether to share <a href="../index.html#commands">commands</a>
with other participants, and in turn, execute other participants' commands 
automatically (default <b>true</b>).
Note that <a href="../index.html#toolbars">toolbar</a> icon buttons and many 
<a href="ui.html#mousemode">mouseclick/pointer operations</a> act via commands.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>port</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>N</i>
<br>
Number of the network port used to connect to the meeting host
(default <b>52194</b>). Unless the default is used,
all who join the meeting must specify the same number 
as specified with <b>meeting start</b>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>updateInterval</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>M</i>
<br>
How often to send a participant's
VR headset and hand-controller positions to the other participants
(every <i>M</i><sup>th</sup> frame, default <b>1</b>, every frame).
For non-VR users, the mouse pointer is not tracked continuously;
the position is only displayed to others when it hovers over an atom.

<h3>Limitations and Potential Developments</h3>
<p>
After the initial scene is shared, the only changes 
that are automatically propagated are moving and scaling 
the displayed structures and (by <a href="#relayCommands">default</a>) 
executing <a href="../index.html#commands">commands</a>.
If a participant makes any unshared changes or
introduces data for which the input file is not directly accessible 
to others (<i>i.e.</i>, the same <a href="open.html"><b>open</b></a>
command will not work for everyone), <b>meeting send</b> 
is needed to share the updated session.
This may be slow for large amounts of data.
</p><p>
An audio connection is not provided,
so it is necessary to set up a separate audio link for remote participants.
</p><p>
Most academic institutions have firewalls that block incoming network 
connections, and require administrative requests to open up network ports.
A more usable design for shared ChimeraX sessions
would have all participants connect to a hub machine.
To allow this to scale to hundreds of instances running simultaneously,
ChimeraX could start a cloud-based server on demand using a commercial service
that accepts the connections and forwards changes to all participants. 
However, this is a complex undertaking that would require 
accounts and payment for commercial services.
