<p>
The <b>rmsd</b> command measures the
root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between two sets of atoms
in their current positions, without performing any fitting.
The value is reported in the <a href="../tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
The two sets must contain the same number of atoms, which will be paired
in the order given. If the order is not given explicitly, chains within
a model are sorted by ID, residues with a chain sorted by number, 
and atoms within a residue sorted by name before pairing. 
</p><p>
To calculate RMSDs from least-squares fitting,
see the <a href="align.html"><b>align</b></a> command.
