<p>
The <b>matchmaker</b> (or <b>mmaker</b>) command
superimposes protein or nucleic acid structures by first creating 
a pairwise sequence alignment, then fitting the aligned residue pairs
using <a href="#matchatom">one atom per residue</a>.
It is the command-line implementation of the
<a href="../tools/matchmaker.html"><b>Matchmaker</b></a> tool.
</p><p>
Residue types and/or protein secondary structure information
can be used to align the sequences, and the pairwise alignment can be shown
in the <a href="../tools/sequenceviewer.html"><b>Sequence Viewer</b></a>.
<a name="matchatom"></a>
Fitting uses one point per residue:  CA in
amino acid residues and C4' in nucleic acid residues.
If a nucleic acid residue lacks a C4' atom 
(some lower-resolution structures are P traces), 
its P atom will be paired with the P atom of the aligned residue.
To use a different set of atoms, including those not in biopolymer chains, 
see the <a href="align.html"><b>align</b></a> command instead.

<p>
The structure to match (<i>matchstruct</i>) 
and a reference structure (<i>refstruct</i>) must be
<a href="atomspec.html">specified</a>.
The <i>matchstruct</i> specifcation can include multiple models to be
matched to <i>refstruct</i> independently, but cannot
include parts of the same model as <i>refstruct</i>.
The <a href="#pairing"><b>pairing</b> mode</a> determines
whether chains or models should be specified.
On occasion, it may be useful to <a href="#restrict">restrict</a>
the calculation to certain residues.
When <i>matchstruct</i> includes only a single model, 
one or more additional models to move along with it 
can be specified with the <b>bring</b> option. 
</p><p>
Sequence <a href="#scoring">alignment scores</a>,
parameter values, and final match RMSDs are reported in the
<a href="../tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
If the fit is <a href="#cutoffDistance">iterated</a>,
the final RMSD over all residue pairs (columns in the sequence alignment) 
will be reported along with the RMSD over the pruned set of pairs.

&ndash; superimpose model 2 onto model 1 using default settings,
and move model 3 along with model 2 as if they were a single rigid
body (retaining the current spatial relationship between models 2 and 3).
Default settings are to recalculate secondary structure assignments

keep the sequence alignment for the <a href="#pairing">best-scoring pair</a>
of chains (one from model 0 and one from model 1), and using that alignment,

<b>2tra</b>, <b>4tra</b> open as models 1 and 2, respectively)
<br>
&ndash; superimpose model 1 onto model 2 using default settings,
except that the Nucleic matrix is required for nucleic acid structures.
<p>
<a name="restrict">
Including specific residues in the
<i>matchstruct</i> and/or <i>refstruct</i> specifications restricts the
calculation to only those residues.
</a>
In general, restriction should only be used in specific cases
to suppress results that would otherwise be obtained.
For example, two chains that would
otherwise align on their N-terminal domains can be forced to align on
their C-terminal domains by specifying only the residues in
the C-terminal domains.  Otherwise, restriction is not recommended,
because full-length alignments tend to be of higher quality, and
<a href="#cutoffDistance">iteration</a> already serves to exclude
poorly superimposed regions from the final fit.
Although the unused parts of matched chains will appear in the resulting
sequence alignment (if <a href="#show">shown</a>), they have simply
been added back in as &ldquo;filler,&rdquo; without consideration of
how the characters align, after alignment and matching of only the
specified residues.

<h3>Options</h3>
<blockquote>
<a name="pairing"><b>pairing</b> &nbsp;<i>mode</i></a>
<br>The <i>mode</i> controls which chain sequences are used 
to construct the reference-match alignment:
<ul>
<li><b>bb</b> (default) - use the pair of chains,
 one from the match model and one from the reference model, 
 with the highest <a href="#scoring">alignment score</a>;
<i>matchstruct</i> and <i>refstruct</i> 
should each specify a model or part of a model
<li><b>bs</b> - use the chain in the match model that gives the best 
<a href="#scoring">alignment score</a> with a specific chain in the reference model;
<i>matchstruct</i> should specify a model or part of a model, and
<i>refstruct</i> should specify a chain
<li><b>ss</b> - pair specific chain(s) in the match model with
specific chain(s) in the reference model; 
<i>matchstruct</i> and <i>refstruct</i> 
should specify equal numbers of chains
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a name="algorithm"><b>alg</b> &nbsp;<i>alignment-algorithm</i></a>
<br>The <i>alignment-algorithm</i> can be:

<li> <b>nw</b> (or <b>needle</b>; default) - Needleman-Wunsch, global
<li> <b>sw</b> (or <b>smith</b>) - Smith-Waterman, local
</ul>
The <a href="#scoring">alignment scoring options</a>
allow for fine-tuning, if needed.

<blockquote>
<a name="show"><b>showAlignment</b> &nbsp;true&nbsp;|&nbsp;<b>false</b></a>
<br>
Whether to show the resulting pairwise sequence alignment(s) in the
<a href="../tools/sequenceviewer.html"><b>Sequence Viewer</b></a>.
When <a href="#cutoffDistance">fit iteration</a> is employed,
the pairs used in the final fit will be highlighted in the sequence alignment
as a <a href="../tools/sequenceviewer.html#regions">region</a> named 
<font style="background:rgb(255,224,204);
border:solid orangered 1px;padding:1px 3px">
<b>matched&nbsp;residues</b></font>.
An RMSD <a href="../tools/sequenceviewer.html#headers">header</a>
is automatically shown above the sequences, with histogram bar heights
representing the spatial variation among residues associated with a column.
<p>
*These sequence alignments are a by-product of superposition,
and may not be entirely correct.
Successful superposition only requires the sequence alignment to be partly
correct, as incorrect portions tend to be excluded from the fit during
<a href="#cutoffDistance">iteration</a>.
If the sequences are easy to align (highly similar),
the sequence alignment is likely to be correct throughout.
However, if the sequences are more distantly related,
parts of the alignment may be incorrect even when the superposition is good.
<!--
When <b>matchmaker</b> is used 
simply to superimpose structures, this is not important.
However, if one also wants a corresponding sequence alignment,
generating a structure-based alignment (after superposition) with
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/matchalign/matchalign.html"><b>Match 
-> Align</b></a> is recommended, especially if the sequences are dissimilar.
The structure-based sequence alignment will provide better
statistics for describing structural similarity (RMSD, <i>etc.</i>)
because more columns will be aligned correctly.
-->
</p><p>
**When the fit has been <a href="#restrict">restricted</a> to specified residues,
the remaining residues of matched chains will still appear in the alignment,
but merely as a convenient compact representation; how they are aligned
is not meaningful.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="cutoffDistance"><b>cutoffDistance</b> 
  &nbsp;<i>cutoff</i>&nbsp;|&nbsp;none</a>
<br>
By default, structures are fit iteratively with a <i>cutoff</i> of 
<b>2.0</b> &Aring; for omitting farther-apart pairs from the fit.
Specifying the <i>cutoff</i> as <b>none</b> turns iteration off.
When iteration is performed,
the sequence alignment is not changed, but residue pairs in the 
alignment can be pruned from the &ldquo;match list&rdquo; used to 
superimpose the structures. In each cycle,
pairs of <a href="#matchatom">atoms</a>
are removed from the match list and the remaining
pairs are fitted, until no matched pair is
more than <i>cutoff</i> apart (default <b>2.0</b> &Aring;).
The atom pairs removed are either the 10% farthest apart of all pairs
or the 50% farthest apart of all pairs exceeding the cutoff, whichever
is the lesser number of pairs. The result of iteration is that the 
best-matching &ldquo;core&rdquo; regions are maximally superimposed, 
and conformationally dissimilar regions such as flexible
loops are not included in the final fit, even though they may be aligned
in the sequence alignment.
