<h3>Command Usage Conventions</h3>
<p>
<a href="../index.html#commands">Command help pages</a> have <b>Usage</b> lines 
that show syntax and options using various fonts and symbols:
<ul>
<li> <b>keywords</b> to be taken literally are not italicized
<li> <b><i>parameters</i></b> that should be replaced with 
an appropriate value (such as a number or word) are italicized
<li><b><i>atom-spec</i></b>, <b><i>model-spec</i></b>, <b><i>spec</i></b>,
and similar terms indicate <a href="atomspec.html">target specification</a>
strings, which generally mean &ldquo;all&rdquo; when left blank
<li> optional keywords and parameters are referred to as
<b><i>options</i></b> or are enclosed in square brackets: <b>[&nbsp;]</b> 
<li> mutually exclusive choices are separated by a vertical bar: <b>|</b>
<li> mutually exclusive choices of a required item are grouped with
parentheses: <b>(&nbsp;)</b>
</ul>
<p>
These brackets, vertical bars, and parentheses in <b>Usage</b> lines are 
merely symbolic and should not be included in the typed command.
</p><p>
In addition to the detailed help, the
<a href="usage.html"><b>usage</b></a> command
can be used to show a brief description of any command
in the <a href="../tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
See also: <a href="help.html"><b>help</b></a>,
<a href="colornames.html">color specification</a>,
<a href="atomspec.html">target specification</a>,
<a href="seqspec.html">sequence specification</a>,
<a href="pointspec.html">specifying points and vectors</a>,
<a href="#cxc-files">ChimeraX command files</a>
</p><p>
The display is updated as needed when a user presses return after entering
a command, or when a <a href="wait.html"><b>wait</b></a>
command is executed within a script.
As mentioned <a href="#multi-commands">below</a>,
multiple commands can be combined into a single line with
semicolon separators.
</p><p>
<a name="truncation"></a>
<b>Truncation</b>
<br>
Command names and keywords can be truncated to unique strings,
with rare exceptions specifically noted. However, the entire 
command name may be needed as the &ldquo;unique string&rdquo; 
if the name of another command (including those in bundles installed from the
<a href="https://cxtoolshed.rbvi.ucsf.edu/"
target="_blank">ChimeraX Toolshed</a>) starts with the same string.
If a truncation matches multiple keywords but one is a simpler compound word,
the simpler one is used; otherwise, an ambiguity error is raised.
</p><p>
Boolean (truth) values can also be truncated, with
synonyms for <b>true</b>: <b>True</b>, <b>1</b>, and
synonyms for <b>false</b>: <b>False</b>, <b>0</b>.
</p><p>
<b>Capitalization</b>
<br>
Command names should be entered as lowercase letters, whereas keywords can be
completely lowercase or capitalized as shown in the documentation,
typically camelCase for compound words. 
</p><p>
<b>Quotation Marks</b>
<br>
Pathnames and string values should be enclosed in quotation marks
if they contain spaces or characters with special meanings in the command line 
(<b>#</b>, <b>:</b>, and others). In unquoted pathnames and strings,
<b>*</b> (wild card), <b>?</b> (single-character wild card), and square brackets
<b>[ ]</b> enclosing alternative single-character matches can be used, as
described <a href="atomspec.html#wildcards">here</a> for atom and residue names.
</p><p>
Space-containing <a href="atomspec.html">target specifications</a>
and multiword <a href="colornames.html#builtin">color names</a>
do not need to be enclosed in quotation marks, except that a
<a href="color.html#palette">palette</a> argument containing
a multiword <a href="colornames.html#builtin">color name</a>
does need to be enclosed in quotation marks.
</p><p>
<a name="browse"></a>
<b>Input from File Browser</b>
<br>
Substituting the word <b>browse</b> for a file or directory pathname brings up
a file browser window for specifying the name and location interactively.
Alternatively, dragging and dropping the icon for a file or directory into the
<a href="../tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line Interface</b></a>
substitutes the corresponding pathname text.

<h3>ChimeraX Command Files</h3>
<p>
ChimeraX command files (scripts) are plain text files 
containing the same commands as entered into the
<a href="../tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line Interface</b></a>.
The filename suffix <b>.cxc</b> is used for this type of file.
Opening a ChimeraX command file in ChimeraX executes the commands.
For command file examples, see 
the ChimeraX <a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/features.html"
target="_blank">feature highlights</a> and 
<a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/gallery.html"
target="_blank">example images</a>.

</p>
Rules and tips:
<ul>
<li><b>Comments</b>:
Lines with # as the first nonspace character and in-line text 
with # as the first nonspace character following a semicolon (;)
are interpreted as comments and ignored.
Blank lines are also allowed.
<br><br>
<li><b>Command truncation</b>:
As discussed <a href="#truncation">above</a>, although
command names can be truncated to unique strings, using the full
command names is more robust against possible name conflicts with other
commands that might be added later.
<br><br>
<a name="multi-commands"></a>
<li><b>Combining commands</b>:
Multiple commands can be combined into a single line with 
semicolon separators.
This is done to make multi-frame actions start simultaneously and/or 
to suppress the display of intermediate states, usually within a script.
Semicolon separators are also needed to define composite (multi-command)
actions with <a href="alias.html"><b>alias</b></a>
or <a href="perframe.html"><b>perframe</b></a>, 
whether interactively or in a script. See also:
<a href="volume.html#calculateSurfaces"><b>volume calculateSurfaces</b></a>
<br><br>
<a name="order"></a>
<li><b>Order of execution</b>:
Even when multiple actions occur within a single image update frame, 
their order is important, and one command may need to precede or follow 
another to give the desired result. In general, the order of execution 
is the order in which the commands are given.
For example, if a script plays a molecular dynamics trajectory and at each
frame shows a molecular surface and colors it by electrostatic potential, 
the coloring should come after the surface calculation.
<br><br>
<li><b>Concurrent <i>vs.</i> serial execution</b>:
The <a href="wait.html"><b>wait</b></a> command is used to enforce
completion of a multi-frame action before initiation of the next command in 
a script; omitting it or waiting for fewer frames allows successive actions 
to overlap or run concurrently.
</ul>
