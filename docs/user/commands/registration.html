<p>
A user is prompted to register after several days of using ChimeraX
on a given device. 
Registration is done using a graphical form,
the <a href="../tools/registration.html"><b>Registration</b></a> tool.
Registration is optional, free of charge, and recommended
to help us understand how the software is used.
</p><p>
The <b>registration status</b> command reports 
in the <a href="../tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>
whether ChimeraX is registered on the device, and if so, the expiration date.
<!-- will change to be auto-extended by active use (accessing toolshed)
A registration is &ldquo;good&rdquo; for a year, after which 
re-registration is encouraged.
-->
If ChimeraX is not registered on the device,
the total number of uses and the number of days of use are reported.
The <b>verbose</b> option shows all registration information, 
if any, or lists the days of use.
